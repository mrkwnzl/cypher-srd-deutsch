### Abilities—P

<!-- P, ID: 073390 -->

**Parry (5 Speed points):** You can deflect incoming attacks quickly. When you activate this ability, for the next ten rounds you ease all Speed defense rolls. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073391 -->

**Passing Mechanic:** You are trained in tasks related to the repair and maintenance of a starcraft. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073392 -->

**Patient Recovery:** You gain an extra ten-minute recovery roll each day. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073393 -->

**Pay It Forward (3 Intellect points):** You can pass on what you’ve learned. When you give another character a suggestion involving their next action that is not an attack, their action is eased for one minute. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073394 -->

**Perfect Control:** You no longer need to make a roll to use Beast Form or change into your normal form. You can change back and forth as your action. When you return to your normal form, you no longer take a penalty to your rolls. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073395 -->

**Perfect Speed Burst (6 Speed points):** You can take two separate actions this round. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073396 -->

**Perfect Stranger (3 Intellect points):** You alter your posture and way of speaking and make a small but real alteration to an outfit (such as putting on or taking off a hat, reversing a cloak, and so on). For the next hour (or as long as you keep up the alteration), even creatures that know you well don’t recognize you. All tasks related to hiding your true identity during this period gain one free level of Effort. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073397 -->

**Perks of Stardom:** You are adept at claiming the rewards that fame can generate. When you are recognized, you can be seated at any restaurant, be let into any government building, be invited to any show or sports event (even if they’re sold out), get a seat at a private function of any sort, or get into any club, no matter how exclusive. When dealing with someone who can’t or won’t immediately give in to your desire, you gain an asset on all tasks related to persuasion if that person recognizes you or is convinced that you’re a celebrity even if they don’t recognize you. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073398 -->

**Permanent Illusion (9 Intellect points):** An illusion (or portion of an illusion) that you create using Minor Illusion or related ability that fits within a 10-foot (3 m) cube becomes permanent.You can permanently end the illusion as an action, but others must expend exceptional ingenuity to prevent the illusion from regenerating even if it has apparently been dispersed. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073399 -->

**Phase Detonation (2+ Might points):** When you use Phase Sprint or Walk Through Walls, you can choose to significantly damage normal matter around you with a blast of transdimensional energy when you first go into or come out of phase (your choice). This detonation inflicts 4 points of damage that ignores Armor to all creatures and objects within immediate range. If you apply Effort to increase the damage rather than ease the task, you deal 2 additional points of damage per level of Effort (instead of 3 points); targets in the area take 1 point of damage even if you fail the attack roll. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073400 -->

**Phase Door (4 Intellect points):** You can phase into a solid object’s surface and then phase out of any other solid object within long range of the first, even if the two objects are not connected. There must be no intervening barriers between the two objects, and you must be aware of or able to see the destination object. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073401 -->

**Phase Foe (6+ Intellect points):** You gather disrupting energy in your fingertip and touch a creature. If the target is an NPC or a creature of level 3 or lower, it becomes phased as if it had used the Ghost ability. However, unless it can figure out how to control its movement while being phased, which most creatures have no experience with, it begins to sink through solid matter. If it can’t control itself or end the effect, it might be gone for good because when it becomes solid again after ten minutes, it’s probably deep in the earth. For each additional level of Effort you apply, you can attempt to affect a target of one level higher. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073402 -->

**Phase Sprint (1+ Speed points):** You can run up to a long distance as long as you take no other actions. During your action and until the beginning of your next turn, you are partially phased, and some attacks pass through you harmlessly. While phased, you gain an asset to your Speed defense tasks, but you lose any benefit from armor you wear.

<!-- P, ID: 073403 -->

Note that some of your other special abilities may enable specific actions that you can take while using Phase Sprint. For instance, when using Disrupting Touch, you can make one touch attack while moving (though this ends your movement). Action.

<!-- H, ID: 073404 -->

> You don’t have to run in one long, straight line when using Phase Sprint, but can instead zig and zag, curve, or even return to where you started.

<!-- H, ID: 073406 -->

> Other abilities can be used with Phase Sprint to unlock additional effects, including Disrupting Touch, Scratch Existence, Invisible Phasing, and Phase Detonation. These abilities are additive enablers, requiring the user to spend points for both abilities, and sometimes from two different Pools.

<!-- P, ID: 073408 -->

**Phased Attack (3 Intellect points):** The attack you make on this turn ignores your foe’s armor. The ability works for whatever kind of attack you use (melee, ranged, energy, and so on). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073409 -->

**Phased Pocket (2+ Intellect points):** You connect yourself for one hour to a small space that is out of phase and moves with you. You can access this space as if it were a convenient pocket or bag, but nobody else can perceive or access the space unless they have the ability to interact with transdimensional areas. The space can hold up to 1 cubic foot. The space is a part of you, so you can’t use it to carry more cyphers than your limit, a detonation cypher activated inside the space harms you, and so on. When the connection ends, anything in the space falls out. For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, the pocket lasts an additional hour. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073410 -->

**Physical Skills:** You are trained in two skills in which you are not already trained. Choose two of the following: balancing, climbing, jumping, running, or swimming. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, you must choose two different skills. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073411 -->

**Physically Gifted:** Any time you spend points from your Might Pool or Speed Pool on an action for any reason, if you roll a 1 on the associated die, you reroll, always taking the second result (even if it’s another 1). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073412 -->

**Pierce (1 Speed point):** This is a well-aimed, penetrating ranged attack. You make an attack and inflict 1 additional point of damage if your weapon has a sharp point. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073413 -->

**Pilot:** You are trained in all tasks related to piloting a starcraft. Generally speaking, piloting tasks are Speed-based tasks, though using sensors and communication instruments are Intellect-based tasks. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073414 -->

**Play to the Crowd (3 Intellect points):** You give a speech that is both rousing and terrifying. Those within short range who can hear and understand you have their next action either eased (an asset) or hindered—you choose, and it can be different for each individual. Action; a few rounds to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 073415 -->

**Poetic License:** You are trained in all social interactions, including persuasion, deception, and intimidation. You also know two additional languages. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073416 -->

**Poison Crafter:** You are trained in crafting, sensing, identifying, and resisting poisons. Your poison crafting has given you some immunity to poisons; you have +5 Armor that applies specifically to poison damage. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073417 -->

**Poison Resistance:** Thanks to an injection of biological agents, a quaff of a magical elixir, a ring from a dying alien, or something just as extreme, you are now immune to poisons, toxins, or any kind of particulate threat. You are not immune to viruses, bacteria, or radiation. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073418 -->

**Post-Apocalyptic Survivor:** You are trained in stealth and Might defense tasks. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073419 -->

**Power Strike (3+ Might points):** If you successfully attack a target, you knock it prone in addition to inflicting damage. The target must be your size or smaller. You can knock down a target larger than you if you apply a level of Effort to do so (rather than to ease the attack). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073420 -->

**Power Crash (3 Intellect points):** You strike your enchanted weapon against the ground (or a similar large surface), creating an explosion of energy that affects an area up to immediate range from that point. (If your enchanted weapon is a ranged weapon, you can instead target a point within close range to be the center of the explosion.) The blast inflicts 2 points of damage to all creatures or objects within the area (except for you). Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073421 -->

**Power Memory:** When you use Copy Power, you only need to have seen the ability used within the past day (instead of the past hour), and using Effort extends how long ago your copying can reach to one day per level of Effort (instead of one hour per level). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073422 -->

**Powered Armor:** You have a suit of powered armor. It is effectively medium armor (+2 to Armor); however, you suffer no Speed penalties for wearing it. Also, your suit grants other benefits: it provides breathable air for up to eight hours and a comfortable environment even in bitter heat, cold, vacuum, or underwater to a depth of 4 miles (6 km); and it allows you to see in the dark up to a short distance. Getting into the suit requires an action (and, of course, access to your suit). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073423 -->

**Powerful Rhetoric (1 Intellect point):** After engaging a creature in conversation for at least a minute, you can attempt to influence how that creature is perceived, promoting it as a friend, dismissing it as a fool, or denouncing it as an enemy. Your words are so well chosen that even you and it are affected, because your conviction and its doubt are paramount. The accuracy of your assessment isn’t important as long as you keep up the rhetoric. From then on (or until you change your rhetoric or the creature offers a convincing defense to those who’ve heard your label), the friend’s social interactions gain an asset, the fool’s social interactions are hindered, or the enemy’s defenses are hindered. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 073424 -->

**Practiced in Armor:** You can wear armor for long periods of time without tiring and can compensate for slowed reactions from wearing armor. You reduce the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1. You start the game with a type of armor of your choice. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073425 -->

**Practiced With All Weapons:** You become practiced with light, medium, and heavy weapons and suffer no penalty when using any kind of weapon. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073426 -->

**Practiced With Guns:** You are practiced with guns and suffer no penalty when using one. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073427 -->

**Practiced With Medium Weapons:** You can use light and medium weapons without penalty. If you wield a heavy weapon, attacks with it are hindered. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073428 -->

**Practiced With Swords:** You are practiced with swords and can use them without penalty. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073429 -->

**Precise Cut:** You inflict 1 additional point of damage with light weapons. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073430 -->

**Precision:** You deal 2 additional points of damage with attacks using weapons that you throw. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073431 -->

**Precognition (6 Intellect points):** You dimly sense the future for the next ten minutes. This has the following effects until the duration expires:

<!-- L, ID: 073432 -->

- Your defense tasks gain an asset.
- You can predict the actions of those around you. You gain an asset to seeing through deceptions and attempts to betray you as well as avoiding traps and ambushes.
- You know what people are probably thinking and what they will say before they say it, which gives you an edge. You gain an asset to all interaction skills.

<!-- /L -->

<!-- P, ID: 073439 -->

Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073440 -->

**Predictive Equation (2 Intellect points):** You observe or study a creature, object, or location for at least one round. The next time you interact with it (possibly in the following round), a related task (such as persuading the creature, attacking it, or defending from its attack) is eased. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073441 -->

**Predictive Model (2+ Intellect points):** If you’ve used Predictive Equation on a creature, object, or location within the last few days, you can learn one random fact about the subject that is pertinent to a topic you designate. If you also have the magic flavor ability Premonition, one use of either ability grants you two random but related facts about the subject. In addition, you can use Predictive Model on the same subject multiple times (even if you’ve learned a creature’s level), but each time you do, you must apply one additional level of Effort than on your previous use. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073442 -->

**Premonition (2 Intellect points):** You learn one random fact about a creature or location that is pertinent to a topic you designate. Alternatively, you can choose to learn a creature’s level; however, if you do so, you cannot learn anything else about it later with this ability. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073443 -->

**Preternatural Senses:** While you are conscious and able to use an action, you cannot be surprised. In addition, you are trained in initiative actions. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073444 -->

**Privileged Nobility:** You are adept at claiming the rewards that a noble background can generate. When recognized, you can be seated at any eating establishment no matter how full, get a room in an inn even if that means others are turned out, be let into any court or other structure where laws are decided or nobility rules, be invited to any gala, and get a seat at a private function of any sort. In addition, you are trained in persuasion. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073445 -->

**Projection (4 Intellect points):** You project an image of yourself to any location you have seen or previously visited. Distance does not matter as long as the location is on the same world as you. The projection copies your appearance, movements, and any sounds you make for the next ten minutes. Anyone present at the location can see and hear you as if you were there. However, you do not perceive through your projection. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073446 -->

**Protective Wall (6+ Might points):** When engaging in combat that directly relates to defending a community you are associated with, you can attack up to five different foes as a single action as long as they are all within immediate range. If you hit an attacker, they are pushed back an immediate distance. All of the attacks have to be the same sort of attack (melee or ranged). Make a separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all of these attacks. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the number of foes you can attack with this ability, one additional foe per level of Effort. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073447 -->

**Protector:** You designate a single character to be your charge. You can change this freely every round, but you can have only one charge at a time. As long as that charge is within immediate range, they gain an asset for Speed defense tasks because you have their back. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073448 -->

**Pry Open (4 Intellect points):** You tear apart the defenses of a creature within long range. Any energy-based defenses it has (such as a force field or a Ward ability) are negated for 1d6 + 1 rounds. If the creature has no energy defenses, its Armor is reduced by 2 for one minute. If it has no energy-based defenses or Armor, attacks against it are eased for one minute. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073449 -->

**Psychic Burst (3+ Intellect points):** You blast waves of mental force into the minds of up to three targets within short range (make an Intellect roll against each target). This burst inflicts 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor). For each 2 additional Intellect points you spend, you can make an Intellect attack roll against an additional target. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073450 -->

**Psychic Passenger (6 Intellect points):** You place your mind into the body of a willing creature you choose within short range and remain in that body for up to one hour. Your own body falls down and becomes insensate until this ability ends.

<!-- P, ID: 073451 -->

You see, hear, smell, touch, and taste using the senses of the creature whose body you inhabit. When you speak, the words come from your defenseless body, and the creature you inhabit hears those words in their mind.

<!-- P, ID: 073452 -->

The creature you inhabit can use your Intellect Edge in place of their own. In addition, you and the creature have an asset on any task that involves perception.

<!-- P, ID: 073453 -->

When you take an action, you use the creature’s body to perform that action if they allow it. Action to initiate.

<!-- H, ID: 073454 -->

> A character should using Psychic Passenger should consider secreting their actual body someplace away from prying eyes and wild beasts, or they may return to an unfortunate situation.

<!-- P, ID: 073456 -->

**Psychic Suggestion (4 Intellect points):** You attempt to make the target take the action you indicate on its next turn. If the action you wish the target to take would cause direct harm to itself or its allies, your mental attack is hindered. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073457 -->

**Psychokinetic Attack (5 Intellect points):** You can use this attack in one of two ways. The first is to pick up a heavy object and hurl it at someone within short range. This attack is an Intellect action, and if successful, it deals 6 points of damage to the target and to the hurled object (which could be another foe, although that would require two rolls—one roll to grab the first foe and another roll to hit the second foe with the first). The second way is to unleash a shattering burst of power that works only against an inanimate object no larger than half your size. Make an Intellect roll to instantly destroy the object; the task is eased by three steps compared to breaking it with brute strength. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073458 -->

**Psychosis (4 Intellect points):** Your words inflict a destructive psychosis in the mind of a target within long range that can understand you, dealing 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) per round. The psychosis can be dispersed if a target uses an action doing nothing but calming and centering itself. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073459 -->

**Pull a Fast One (3 Intellect points):** When you’re running a con, picking a pocket, fooling or tricking a dupe, sneaking something by a guard, and so on, you gain an asset on the task. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073460 -->

**Punish All the Guilty (3 Speed points):** You can attack up to five foes within immediate range that you have designated as guilty with your Designation ability, all as part of the same action in one round. Make separate attack rolls for each foe, but all attacks count as a single action in a single round. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to all attacks. If you also have the Spin Attack ability, you inflict 1 additional point of damage when you use Punish All the Guilty. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073461 -->

**Punish the Guilty (2 Might points):** For the next ten minutes, if you attack someone you have designated as guilty with your Designation ability, you inflict 2 additional points of damage. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073462 -->

**Push (2 Intellect points):** You telekinetically push a creature or object an immediate distance in any direction you wish. You must be able to see the target, which must be your size or smaller, must not be affixed to anything, and must be within short range. The push is quick, and the force is too crude to be manipulated. For example, you can’t use this ability to pull a lever or close a door. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073463 -->

**Push Off and Throw (3 Speed points):** You can make precise, point-to-point jumps in microgravity, which means you can move up to a long distance and make a melee attack or attempt to grab a foe of your size or smaller. If you successfully grab your foe, you move your foe up to a short distance from its original position.

<!-- P, ID: 073464 -->

Alternatively, while you come to a standstill (or move off in an immediate distance per round in any direction you choose) you can launch your foe in a chosen direction through space at a rate of a short distance per round. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073465 -->

**Push on Through (2 Might points):** You ignore the effects of terrain while moving for one hour. Enabler.
