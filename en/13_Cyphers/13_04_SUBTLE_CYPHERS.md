### SUBTLE CYPHERS

<!-- P, ID: 130026 -->

Subtle (nonphysical) cyphers are a way to introduce cyphers into a game without overt “powered stuff”—no potions, alien crystals, or anything of that nature. They’re most useful, perhaps, in a modern or horror setting without obvious fantasy elements. Subtle cyphers are more like the inherent abilities PCs have, adding boosts to Edge, recovering points from Pools, coming up with ideas, and so on. In general, these are commonplace, non-supernatural effects—a subtle cypher wouldn’t create a laser beam or allow a character to walk through a wall. They don’t break the fragile bubble of believability in genres where flashy powers and abilities don’t make a lot of sense.

Subtle cyphers are particularly nice in a genre where the PCs are supposed to be normal people. The cyphers can simply be an expression of innate capabilities in characters that aren’t always dependable. And in many ways, that’s probably more realistic than an ability you can count on with certainty, because in real life, some days you can jump over a fence, and some days you just can’t.

Concepts for subtle cyphers include the following:

**Good fortune:** Once in a while, things just go your way. You’re in the right place at the right time.

**Inspirations:** Sometimes you get inspired to do something you’ve never done before and might not be able to do again. Call it adrenaline mixed with the right motivation, or just doing the right thing at the right place at the right time. Who can really define it? Life’s funny that way.

**Alien concepts:** Complex and utterly inhuman memes enter our world and worm their way into and out of human consciousness. When this happens, it can cause mental distress and disorientation. It can also grant impossible abilities and advantages.

**Blessings:** In a fantasy world, there are nine gods. Each morning, all intelligent residents of the world pray to one of the gods, and some of the faithful gain a divine blessing. Some people believe that praying to different gods gives you different blessings.

**Earworms:** You know how some songs pop into your head and just won’t leave? There’s a power to those songs, and the right people know how to harness it. Make the songs disturbing or reminiscent of evil chants, and you’ve got a perfect cypher concept for a horror campaign.

**Mysterious transmissions:** What’s that buzzing? That mechanical chittering? Those numbers repeating over and over? And why can only some people hear it? A few who are aware of the sounds have learned how to make use of them.

**Supernatural powers:** Mental or mystical energies constantly shift and change, ebb and flow. But you’ve figured out how to attune your mind to them. There are no physical actions or paraphernalia required—just an inner conduit to the numinous.

#### DISCOVERING SUBTLE CYPHERS

<!-- P, ID: 130038 -->

Since subtle cyphers aren’t physical objects, GMs will need to figure out when to give PCs new ones to replace the ones they have used. The cyphers probably shouldn’t be tied to actions entirely under the characters’ control—in other words, they shouldn’t come as a result of meditation or anything of that nature. Instead, the GM should choose significant points in the story when new cyphers might simply come unbidden to the PCs. In the broader view, this is no different than manifest cyphers placed as treasure in a creature’s lair, a secret cache, or somewhere else for the characters to find. Either way, the GM is picking good spots to “refill” potentially used cypher-based abilities.

Subtle cyphers are often found in groups of one to six (the GM can roll 1d6 to determine the number). The GM might randomly assign the cyphers to each PC who has space for more, or present a selection of cyphers to the group and allow the players to choose which ones they want for their characters. Characters should immediately know what their subtle cyphers do. If a PC activates a healing subtle cypher when they think it’s something to help pick a lock, that’s a waste of a useful character ability.

PCs might be able to obtain subtle cyphers from NPCs or in unusual circumstances as gifts, boons, or blessings, even asking for a particular kind of subtle cypher, such as healing, protection, or skill. For example, PCs who make a donation at a temple of a healing goddess could ask to receive a blessing (subtle cypher) that allows them to speak a healing prayer that restores points to one of their Pools. An NPC wizard who owes the PCs a favor might cast a spell on them that deflects one weapon if they say a magic word. An alien pylon might grant knowledge of a strange mental code that lets a person see in the dark for a few hours.

A PC can also acquire a new subtle cypher by spending 1 XP on one of the following player intrusions:

**General cypher:** You ask the GM for a general subtle cypher, such as “healing,” “movement,” “defense,” or perhaps something as specific as “flight.” The GM gives you a cypher that meets that description and randomly determines its level. If you don’t have space for this cypher, you immediately lose one of your current cyphers (your choice) and the new cypher takes its place.

<!-- P, ID: 130043 -->

**Specific cypher:** You ask the GM for a specific subtle cypher (such as a curative or stim) of a specific level. Make an Intellect roll with a difficulty equal to the cypher’s level plus 1. If you have had this cypher before, the task is eased. If you fail the roll, you do not gain a cypher. If you succeed, the GM gives you that subtle cypher at that level. If you don’t have space for this new cypher, you immediately lose one of your current cyphers (your choice) and the new cypher takes its place. Whether or not you succeed at the roll, the 1 XP is spent.
