**Aquatic:** The animal either breathes water instead of air or is able to breathe water in addition to breathing air.

**Armor:** The animal has a thick hide or shell, granting +1 to Armor.

**Constrict:** The animal can grip its opponent fast after making a melee attack (usually with a bite or claw), easing attack rolls against that foe on later turns until the animal releases the foe.

**Fast:** The animal can move a long distance on its turn instead of a short distance.

**Flying:** The animal can fly, which (depending on the type of animal) may be up to a short or long distance on its turn.

**Hands:** The animal has paws or hands that are nearly as agile as those of a human. Unlike with most animal shapes, the animalâ€™s tasks that require hands are not hindered (although the GM may decide that some tasks requiring human agility, such as playing a flute, are still hindered).

**Scent:** The animal has a strong sense of smell, gaining an asset on tracking and dealing with darkness or blindness.

**Small:** The animal is considerably smaller than a human, easing its Speed defense tasks but hindering tasks to move heavy things.

**Venom:** The animal is poisonous (usually through a bite), inflicting 1 additional point of damage.
