### CUSTOMIZING FOCI

<!-- P, ID: 062762 -->

Sometimes not everything about a focus is right for a characterâ€™s concept, or perhaps the GM needs additional guidelines for creating a new focus. Either way, the solution lies in looking at foci abilities at their most basic default levels.

<!-- P, ID: 062763 -->

At any tier, a player can select one of the following abilities in place of the ability granted by the tier. Many of these replacement abilities, particularly at the higher tiers, might involve body modification, integration with high-tech devices, learning powerful magic spells, uncovering forbidden secrets, or something similar appropriate to the genre.
