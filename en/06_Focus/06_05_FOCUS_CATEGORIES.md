### FOCUS CATEGORIES

#### ALLY USE

<!-- P, ID: 062323 -->

Foci that prioritize providing NPC followers to the character are ally use foci. The followers give aid to the PC in a variety of ways, but at base they usually provide an asset to the character’s actions.

<!-- P, ID: 062324 -->

Multiple potential themes exist within the ally use category, from abilities that allow a character to summon or craft allies to those that allow them to attract allies through fame, magic, or essential authority or charisma.

<!-- P, ID: 062325 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062326 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary for the character to keep an ally. For instance, someone with a focus that uses super-science to create robot allies would require tools to build and repair those allies. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

<!-- P, ID: 062327 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The NPC ally’s tasks are eased on its next turn.

<!-- P, ID: 062328 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** The NPC ally gains an immediate extra action.

<!-- P, ID: 062329 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062330 -->

- Builds Robots
- Consorts With the Dead
- Controls Beasts
- Exists in Two Places at Once
- Leads
- Masters the Swarm
- Shepherds Spirits

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062347 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants a level 2 NPC follower to the character, or gives a similar benefit provided by an NPC. Alternatively, lay the groundwork for gaining such NPC allies at higher tiers by choosing an ability that gives the character influence over others.

<!-- P, ID: 062348 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill. For instance, training in a skill related to the kind of NPC follower the character gains would be appropriate.

<!-- P, ID: 062349 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants influence over similar kinds of NPCs as the follower gained at the previous tier. If no follower was gained at the previous tier, this ability should provide that benefit now.

<!-- P, ID: 062350 -->

Sometimes a secondary ability might be appropriate in addition to the ability provided above, perhaps a low-power ability that grants 2 or 3 points to a Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 062351 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062352 -->

One option should be a mid-tier ability that improves the NPC follower previously provided (usually from level 2 to level 3) or grants an additional follower.

<!-- P, ID: 062353 -->

The other option should be something that benefits the character—perhaps an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their influence over their followers (or potential followers).

<!-- P, ID: 062354 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that gives the character an offensive or defensive capability if they haven’t previously gained one, preferably within the theme of the focus. For instance, if the character gains followers because of their charisma, this ability might let them command foes for brief periods. If the character gains followers by building or calling them, this ability might let them affect entities of the same type that are not already their followers.

<!-- P, ID: 062355 -->

Alternatively, this ability might further improve a previously gained follower from level 3 to level 4, or grant an additional follower.

<!-- P, ID: 062356 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose an ability that improves the character by providing a defense, an improved stat Pool, or another kind of protection.

<!-- P, ID: 062357 -->

Alternatively, this ability could open a new front in influencing and calling NPC allies related to the focus’s theme. For instance, someone who keeps beast allies might gain an ability to call a horde of lesser beasts. Someone who builds robots might gain an ability to build several lesser robot helpers. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062358 -->

Finally, this ability might improve a previously gained follower to level 5.

<!-- P, ID: 062359 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062360 -->

One of the abilities should improve a previously gained follower to level 5, if that wasn’t already provided at tier 5. If that’s the case, this ability might be provided in addition to two other related abilities.

<!-- P, ID: 062361 -->

Another high-tier option could provide a handful of level 3 followers to the character.

<!-- P, ID: 062362 -->

The last high-tier ability could open a new front in influencing and calling NPC allies related to the focus’s theme. For instance, someone who gains followers through high charisma and training might gain an ability to learn otherwise impossible-to-glean information.

#### BASIC

<!-- P, ID: 062365 -->

Foci that rely mostly on providing skill training, assets to tasks, and bumps to stat Pools and Edge in order to improve a character fall within the basic category. An overarching theme is also included, as with most of the other categories, that makes sense of the various basic abilities provided.

<!-- P, ID: 062366 -->

In addition, because the benefits provided by such foci are mostly straightforward (usually with a few exceptions), most basic foci would also be appropriate for non-fantastic campaigns where magic, super-science, or psychic abilities normally don’t come into play. That said, just because the abilities granted by basic foci are straightforward doesn’t mean they are not potent when combined with the abilities granted by type, descriptor, cyphers, and other character aspects.

<!-- P, ID: 062367 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062368 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to fulfill the overarching theme of the focus. For instance, a focus called Would Rather Be Reading should grant a handful of books to the character. A focus called Works for a Living should provide a set of tools.

<!-- P, ID: 062369 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** Next action is eased.

<!-- P, ID: 062370 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** Make a free, no-action recovery roll that doesn’t count against daily recovery rolls.

<!-- P, ID: 062371 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062372 -->

- Doesn’t Do Much
- Interprets the Law
- Learns Quickly
- Works for a Living
- Would Rather Be Reading

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062385 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose an ability that grants training or an asset to skills associated with the focus’s theme, or that grants 5 or 6 points to a particular Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 062386 -->

Alternatively, choose an ability that grants only 2 or 3 points to a particular Pool and an ability that provides training or an asset to just one task.

<!-- P, ID: 062387 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 1.

<!-- P, ID: 062388 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062389 -->

One option should be a non-fantastic ability that improves the character’s abilities within the focus’s theme. For instance, if the theme involves paying attention in some fashion, an information-gathering ability might be appropriate.

<!-- P, ID: 062390 -->

The other option should be something that either improves the character’s Edge in an appropriate stat or provides the character with some kind of defense.

<!-- P, ID: 062391 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose another ability that grants additional training or an asset to skills associated with the focus’s theme, or that grants 5 or 6 points to a particular Pool best suited to the focus. Or choose two abilities that provide only 2 or 3 points plus another tier 4 ability that improves a single task or skill.

<!-- P, ID: 062392 -->

Alternatively, provide a branch-out ability suggested at tier 5.

<!-- P, ID: 062393 -->

Finally, if the focus has yet to grant some kind of defense, a defensive ability could be provided here.

<!-- P, ID: 062394 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose an ability that allows the character to branch out slightly—perhaps one like Expert Skill that allows them to automatically succeed on a task they’re trained in.

<!-- P, ID: 062395 -->

Alternatively, if a nonstandard benefit was provided at tier 4, provide the benefits suggested at tier 4 here.

<!-- P, ID: 062396 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062397 -->

One option should be an ability that provides another 5 or 6 points to a particular Pool best suited to the focus, or that the character can divide up as they wish. Alternatively, training in offense or defense would also be appropriate.

<!-- P, ID: 062398 -->

The other tier 6 option should give the character a brand-new ability within their theme, but not one that strays into the realm of the fantastic. For instance, an ability that allows a character to take two actions instead of one would be reasonable. Granting additional training, assets, or Edge would also be fine.

#### ENERGY MANIPULATION

<!-- P, ID: 062401 -->

Energy manipulation foci offer abilities that can call fire, electricity, force, magnetism, or nonstandard forms of energy such as cold, stone, or something stranger like “void” or “shadow.” These abilities usually give a character a way to achieve something of a balance between attacking enemies and granting themselves or allies additional protection. The focus usually also offers abilities that provide other ways to use specific energy for things like transportation, creating large concentrations of energy that can affect multiple targets, or creating a temporary object or barrier of energy.

<!-- P, ID: 062402 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062403 -->

**Additional Equipment:** One or more pieces of equipment immune to the energy manipulated, which might be a set of clothes. Alternatively, something related to the energy being generated. Some foci in this category don’t require additional equipment.

<!-- P, ID: 062404 -->

**Energy Abilities:** If a character type grants special abilities that normally use some other kind of energy, they now produce the kind used by this focus. For example, if a character uses this focus to manipulate electricity, their force blasts become blasts of electricity. These alterations change nothing except the type of damage and any knock-on effects (for instance, electricity might temporarily short out electronic systems).

<!-- P, ID: 062405 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The target or something near the target is hindered because of residual energy.

<!-- P, ID: 062406 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** An important item on the target’s person is destroyed.

<!-- P, ID: 062407 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062408 -->

- Absorbs Energy
- Bears a Halo of Fire
- Dances With Dark Matter
- Rides the Lightning
- Thunders
- Wears a Sheen of Ice

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062423 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that either inflicts damage or provides protection using the appropriate energy type in some fashion.

<!-- P, ID: 062424 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the energy type. For instance, a focus that manipulates cold might grant an ability to create snow sculptures. A focus that manipulates electricity might grant an ability to charge a depleted artifact or have an asset for dealing with electrical systems. A focus that absorbs energy might grant an ability to release it as a basic attack. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062425 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 1.

<!-- P, ID: 062426 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062427 -->

One option should be an ability that inflicts damage using the appropriate energy type (and possibly a related effect).

<!-- P, ID: 062428 -->

The other should grant enhanced movement by use of the appropriate energy type, give additional protection provided by the preferred energy, or use the energy in a completely new way, such as by draining the energy from a machine (if using electricity), entombing a victim in a layer of ice (if using cold), creating perfect silence (if using sound), creating a dazzling blast of illumination (if using light), and so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062429 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose whichever kind of ability wasn’t chosen at tier 3.

<!-- P, ID: 062430 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage (and possibly a related effect) that can affect more than one target using the appropriate energy type, or an ability that uses the energy in some fashion not previously used, as described in tiers 3 and 6.

<!-- P, ID: 062431 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062432 -->

One of the high-tier abilities should use the preferred energy to inflict a lot of damage to a single target or to several.

<!-- P, ID: 062433 -->

The other option should use the appropriate energy type to accomplish a task not previously provided by lower-tier abilities, such as fashioning a fiery follower (if using fire), teleporting a great distance as a blast of lightning (if using electricity), creating solid objects out of the energy, and so on.

#### ENVIRONMENT MANIPULATION

<!-- P, ID: 062436 -->

Foci that allow a character to move objects, affect gravity, create objects (or illusions of objects), and so on are environment manipulation foci. Given that, in many cases, energy is used as part of this process, this category and energy manipulation overlap to some extent. Environment manipulation foci prioritize abilities that indirectly affect enemies and allies via objects, forces, and alterations of the surroundings; energy manipulation foci prioritize directly damaging targets with the chosen energy or force.

<!-- P, ID: 062437 -->

For example, rather than blasting a foe with a gravity pulse that does damage, a character using an environment manipulation focus based on gravity is more likely to have abilities that hold a target in place, use gravity to throw heavy objects as an attack, or lower gravity in a particular area or even on a particular object.

<!-- P, ID: 062438 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062439 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to manipulate the surrounding environment. For instance, someone with a focus that grants the ability to craft objects would require basic tools. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

<!-- P, ID: 062440 -->

**Environment Manipulation Abilities:** Foci themes that involve imagery or visible energies can affect the look of your type abilities. Such alterations, if any, do nothing but change the appearance of effects. If gravity is manipulated, perhaps a telltale bluish glow permeates all ability uses, including type abilities. If illusion is generated, perhaps flamboyant visual and auditory qualities accompany type abilities, such as the appearance of a tentacled beast holding a target in place when Stasis is used. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062441 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The target gets turned around, and its next attack is hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 062442 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** The character is refreshed and recovers 4 points to one Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 062443 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062444 -->

- Awakens Dreams
- Blazes With Radiance
- Calculates the Incalculable
- Controls Gravity
- Crafts Illusions
- Crafts Unique Objects
- Employs Magnetism
- Focuses Mind Over Matter

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062463 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants a basic use of an ability that alters the environment (or predicts it) using the focus’s theme. For instance, a gravity-affecting focus might provide an ability that makes a target lighter or heavier. An illusion-crafting focus might grant an ability that allows the creation of an image. An object-making focus might grant a basic proficiency in creating a particular kind of object. A predictive focus might calculate outcomes and provide the character with the benefits of that foreknowledge. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062464 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge.

<!-- P, ID: 062465 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that provides a new defensive or offensive capability related to the focus’s theme.

<!-- P, ID: 062466 -->

Alternatively, this ability might provide an additional or brand-new capability to manipulate the environment related to the focus’s theme.

<!-- P, ID: 062467 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062468 -->

One option should be a mid-tier ability related to the focus’s theme that provides an additional environment manipulation capacity or further improves the basic environment manipulation ability previously granted. This ability isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides either an all-new ability related to the basic ability, or one that increases the strength, range, or some other extension of the previously unlocked basic ability.

<!-- P, ID: 062469 -->

The other mid-tier option should provide an offensive or defensive ability related to the specific form of movement the focus provides, if possible.

<!-- P, ID: 062470 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that is either an offensive or a defensive use of the ability, whichever one wasn’t chosen as an option in the previous tier.

<!-- P, ID: 062471 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the environment-manipulation ability. For instance, if the focus-granted manipulation is illusory, this ability might haunt a target with terrifying images. If the focus is gravity based, it might unlock flight. If magnetic, it might allow the user to reshape metal. If the focus grants telekinetic powers, this ability could allow a character to hurl massive objects at foes. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062472 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062473 -->

One of the abilities should provide either an offensive or a defensive ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).

<!-- P, ID: 062474 -->

The other option should be something that further explores the use of the basic environment manipulation capability. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability related to the kind of manipulation offered, or a different way of using that ability to unlock an as-yet-unexplored facet of the ability.

#### EXPLORATION

<!-- P, ID: 062477 -->

Foci that allow a character to gather information, survive in unfamiliar environments, and find their way to new locations or track down particular creatures and foes are exploration foci. Surviving in unfamiliar environments requires a reasonable selection of defensive options; however, abilities that allow a character to find and learn are prioritized.

<!-- P, ID: 062478 -->

Exploration foci rely on a variety of methods, though training and expertise are the mainstays. Some methods require specific tools (such as a vehicle) to grant the benefits provided, while others might rely on the supernatural or super-science to learn new things and explore strange places from afar.

<!-- P, ID: 062479 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062480 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to explore. For instance, starting maps and/or a compass would be basic equipment, while someone who uses psychic abilities might require a mirror or crystal sphere to gaze into. Equipment might also include access to a vehicle required for exploration, as previously noted.

<!-- P, ID: 062481 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** You have an asset on any action that involves using your senses, such as perceiving or attacking, until the end of the next round.

<!-- P, ID: 062482 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** Your Intellect Edge increases by 1 until the end of the next round.

<!-- P, ID: 062483 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062484 -->

- Explores Dark Places
- Infiltrates
- Operates Undercover
- Pilots Starcraft
- Sees Beyond
- Separates Mind From Body

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062499 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants the character basic exploratory, survival, or information-gathering capabilities within the focus’s theme.

<!-- P, ID: 062500 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill (though this may already be covered in the main ability). Alternatively, it might offer a simple bonus of 2 or 3 points to the Might Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 062501 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose another low-tier ability that grants an additional capability related to exploration, survival, or information gathering.

<!-- P, ID: 062502 -->

For instance, a focus dedicated to surviving savage conditions might offer an ability (or two) that makes it easier to avoid natural hazards, poisons, difficult terrain, and so on. A focus dedicated to exploration of a particular area might grant abilities to gain access to that area, or a capability that others normally lack (like the ability to see in the dark).

<!-- P, ID: 062503 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062504 -->

One option should further improve the basic exploration ability granted, or give a new exploratory, survival, or information-gathering ability.

<!-- P, ID: 062505 -->

The other option should be something that benefits the character, either an offensive or defensive ability (especially if this focus hasn’t already granted that) or something that further broadens the character’s ability to explore in the focus’s chosen realm.

<!-- P, ID: 062506 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier offensive or defensive ability (whichever wasn’t offered at tier 3) that benefits the character. Alternatively, if offensive and defensive abilities are already well represented, choose a different mid-tier ability that broadens the character’s ability to explore, survive, or gather information.

<!-- P, ID: 062507 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier ability that alleviates some of the penalties for exploring, surviving, or gathering information in a normally inhospitable place.

<!-- P, ID: 062508 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062509 -->

One option should further improve the basic exploration-themed ability previously granted, or give a brand-new exploratory, survival, or information-gathering ability.

<!-- P, ID: 062510 -->

The other option should be something that benefits the character, either an offensive or defensive ability, or yet another ability that further broadens their capacity to explore in the focus’s chosen realm.

#### INFLUENCE

<!-- P, ID: 062513 -->

Foci that prioritize authority and influence—whether that’s to make people or machines do as commanded, to help others, or to rise to some other prestigious and significant position—fall within the influence category.

<!-- P, ID: 062514 -->

These foci grant influence through training and persuasion, by direct mental manipulation, by using fame to get people’s attention and influence their actions, or simply by knowing and learning things that affect later decisions. In this sense, the concept of influence is broad.

<!-- P, ID: 062515 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062516 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to achieve the influence suggested should be granted as additional equipment. Some influence foci don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

<!-- P, ID: 062517 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The range or duration of the influencing ability is doubled.

<!-- P, ID: 062518 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** An ally or indicated target can take an additional action.

<!-- P, ID: 062519 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062520 -->

- Commands Mental Powers
- Conducts Weird Science
- Fuses Mind and Machine
- Is Idolized by Millions
- Solves Mysteries
- Talks to Machines
- Works the System

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062537 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that allows the character to learn something significant enough that they can choose a smart course of action (or use that knowledge to persuade or intimidate). How the character learns the information varies by the specifics of the focus. One character might do experiments to learn answers, another might open a telepathic link with others to trade information secretly and quickly, and still another might simply be trained in interaction tasks.

<!-- P, ID: 062538 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge.

<!-- P, ID: 062539 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that improves the character’s ability to apply influence. This might open an additional front on the focus’s basic theme or simply further enhance the basic ability already provided. For instance, this tier 2 ability could ease influence-related tasks by a few steps, allow a telepath to read the minds of others who have secrets they’d otherwise not reveal, or grant influence over physical objects (either to improve them or to learn more about them). And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062540 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062541 -->

One option should provide an offensive or defensive capability related to the focus’s specific kind of influence, if possible. For instance, an inventor might create a serum that gives them increased abilities (which could be used for offense or defense), a telepath might have some method of blasting foes with mental energy, and someone with only the basic skills of debate and influence through fame might have to rely on weapon training or their entourage.

<!-- P, ID: 062542 -->

The other mid-tier option should provide an additional ability to influence in the theme of the focus, or further improve the basic influence ability previously granted. This option isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides either an all-new ability related to the basic ability, or increases the strength, range, or some other extension of the previously unlocked basic ability. For instance, a telepath might have a psychic suggestion ability.

<!-- P, ID: 062543 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that is either an offensive or a defensive use of the influence ability, whichever one wasn’t chosen as an option in the previous tier.

<!-- P, ID: 062544 -->

Alternatively, this ability could grant an additional capability related to the kind of influence the focus provides.

<!-- P, ID: 062545 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the specific influence ability granted at lower tiers.

<!-- P, ID: 062546 -->

Alternatively, choose an ability not previously gained at a lower tier, one that opens a new front on the particular influence capability. For instance, if the focus-granted influence is telepathic, the tier 5 ability might allow a character to see into the future to gain assets for dealing with enemies (and allies).

<!-- P, ID: 062547 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062548 -->

One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).

<!-- P, ID: 062549 -->

The other option should be something that further explores the use of the basic influence ability provided by the focus. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability related to the kind of influence used, or a different way of using that ability to unlock an as-yet-unexplored facet of the ability.

#### IRREGULAR

<!-- P, ID: 062552 -->

Most foci have a basic theme, a “character story” that logically leads to a series of related abilities. However, certain foci themes are so wide that they don’t fit into any other category except an irregular one of their own.

<!-- P, ID: 062553 -->

Irregular foci provide a basket of disparate abilities. Usually that’s because the overarching theme is one that demands variability and access to several different kinds of abilities. Often, these foci are found in genres that suggest additional rule tweaks to leverage their use even further, such as power shifts in the superhero genre and spellcasting in the fantasy genre. However, other irregular foci are possible.

<!-- P, ID: 062554 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062555 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to the focus’s theme. For instance, a superhero-themed focus might grant a superhero costume.

<!-- P, ID: 062556 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The target is also dazed for one round, during which time all of its tasks are hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 062557 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** The target is stunned and loses its next turn.

<!-- P, ID: 062558 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062559 -->

- Channels Divine Blessings
- Descends From Nobility
- Emerged From the Obelisk
- Flies Faster Than a Bullet
- Masters Spells
- Speaks for the Land

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062574 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that a first-tier character should have.

<!-- P, ID: 062575 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill. Alternatively, it might offer a simple bonus of 2 or 3 points to a Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 062576 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that’s presumably not immediately related to the one provided at tier 1. That said, if a defense wasn’t provided at tier 1, tier 2 is a good place to add it.

<!-- P, ID: 062577 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062578 -->

One option should provide one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers.

<!-- P, ID: 062579 -->

The other option should include a method of attack if none has previously been granted. Alternatively, if the lower-tier abilities don’t quite get the character where they need to be, this option might further increase a capability unlocked at a lower tier.

<!-- P, ID: 062580 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers.

<!-- P, ID: 062581 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier ability that grants one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers.

<!-- P, ID: 062582 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062583 -->

One option should grant one of the benefits the focus theme promises, one that may not be immediately related to those provided at earlier tiers. However, this ability might also provide an ultimate version of a lower-tier ability if a mid-tier or low-tier option wasn’t quite sufficient.

<!-- P, ID: 062584 -->

The other option should provide an alternate method to round out the character in a way that doesn’t replicate the first tier 6 option. For instance, if the first option provided some kind of attack, this one might be an interaction, information-gathering, or healing ability, depending on the focus’s overarching theme.

#### MOVEMENT EXPERTISE

<!-- P, ID: 062587 -->

Foci that prioritize novel forms of movement—in order to excel in combat, escape situations most others can’t, move with stealth for purposes of theft or escape, or move into locations normally inaccessible—fall within the movement expertise category. These foci usually have methods of granting either offense or defense through movement, though they may provide some means of doing both.

<!-- P, ID: 062588 -->

The classic movement expertise focus is one that relies on speed to make more attacks and avoid being hit, though general agility might also provide the same benefit. Other foci in this category might fall within the theme by granting a character the ability to become immaterial, to change their form into something like water or air, or to instantly move via teleportation.

<!-- P, ID: 062589 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062590 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to achieve great speeds, change state, or otherwise gain the benefit of the focus should be granted as additional equipment. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

<!-- P, ID: 062591 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The target is dazed, and their next action is hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 062592 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** The target is stunned and loses their next action.

<!-- P, ID: 062593 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062594 -->

- Exists Partially Out of Phase
- Moves Like a Cat
- Moves Like the Wind
- Runs Away
- Shreds the Walls of the World
- Travels Through Time
- Works the Back Alleys

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062611 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that grants the basic benefit of the specific movement style, whether that’s enhanced speed, agility, immateriality, and so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062612 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. If the basic benefit of the movement demands some kind of additional understanding or training, this ability could be that. Alternatively, if the movement provided seems like it should also unlock a basic offensive or defensive benefit (relying on the use of the initial basic ability), append it as well.

<!-- P, ID: 062613 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that provides a new offensive or defensive capability related to the focus’s theme.

<!-- P, ID: 062614 -->

Alternatively, this ability might provide some additional capability related to the form of movement that grants useful information to the character that would normally be inaccessible to someone without the focus.

<!-- P, ID: 062615 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062616 -->

One option should provide an additional movement capacity or further improve the basic movement capacity, related to the focus’s theme. This isn’t directly offensive or defensive, but provides the character with a new level of ability or an all-new ability related to their basic movement ability.

<!-- P, ID: 062617 -->

The other option should provide either an offensive or a defensive capability related to the specific form of movement the focus provides.

<!-- P, ID: 062618 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages provided by focus’s movement-enhancing paradigm. This could provide a new or better form of defense (directly, or indirectly if moving to a location or time where danger doesn’t threaten), or a new or better form of offense.

<!-- P, ID: 062619 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier penultimate use of the movement-related ability. For instance, if the focus-provided movement is temporal, this ability might allow actual (if brief) jaunts of time travel. If the focus enhances speed, this ability might allow the character to move up to a very long distance with one action. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062620 -->

Alternatively, unlock an as-yet-unexplored related ability that could derive from the basic movement power provided by the focus.

<!-- P, ID: 062621 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062622 -->

One of the options should provide either an offensive or a defensive ability, opposite the ability provided at tier 4 (though high tier rather than mid tier).

<!-- P, ID: 062623 -->

The other option should be something that further explores the use of the basic movement ability. If the tier 5 choice was the penultimate ability, this might be an even better ultimate ability related to the movement.

#### STRIKER COMBAT

<!-- P, ID: 062626 -->

Striker combat foci prioritize dealing damage in battle over other concerns. Foci in this category offer defensive abilities as well, but they emphasize abilities that provide ways to spike damage to heights that other foci normally don’t reach.

<!-- P, ID: 062627 -->

To achieve this end, a striker combat focus might offer mastery of a particular style of martial combat, which could be training with a particular weapon or martial art, or the use of a unique tool (or even a kind of energy). A style might be something as singular as being the best at fighting a particular kind of enemy, or something much broader, such as adopting a particularly vicious or unsporting style. A striker combatant might use fire, force, or magnetism as their preferred method of spiking damage.

<!-- P, ID: 062628 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062629 -->

**Additional Equipment:** The weapon, tool, or other special item or substance (if any) required to engage in the particular style of combat. For instance, a dose of level 5 poison for Fights Dirty or Murders, a trophy from a previously defeated foe for Battles Robots, or stylish clothes for Fights With Panache.

<!-- P, ID: 062630 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** The target is so dazzled by your expertise that it is dazed for one round, hindering all of its tasks.

<!-- P, ID: 062631 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** Make an immediate additional attack using an attack provided by the focus as part of your turn.

<!-- P, ID: 062632 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062633 -->

- Battles Robots
- Fights Dirty
- Fights With Panache
- Hunts
- Is Licensed to Carry
- Looks for Trouble
- Masters Weaponry
- Murders
- Needs No Weapon
- Performs Feats of Strength
- Rages
- Slays Monsters
- Throws With Deadly Accuracy
- Wields Two Weapons at Once

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062664 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that inflicts additional damage when a character attacks using the focus’s particular fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy.

<!-- P, ID: 062665 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. For instance, a focus that grants proficiency in a special weapon might offer training in crafting tasks associated with that weapon. A focus that grants increased damage against a particular kind of foe might offer training in skills to recognize, locate, or just have general knowledge about that foe. A fighting style that involves fighting in a vicious or dirty manner might provide training in intimidation. And so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062666 -->

If the focus is about fighting a particular enemy, additional secondary powers (more than might otherwise be offered) may be appropriate. Those either further enhance effectiveness against the chosen enemy, or offer broader but related abilities that give the character who takes the focus some functionality even when not fighting that enemy.

<!-- P, ID: 062667 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense using the weapon, weapon style, or chosen energy. If the weapon style is being especially good at fighting a certain kind of foe, the ability should be a defense against that kind of foe. Alternatively, the focus might offer another method for increasing damage within the chosen paradigm.

<!-- P, ID: 062668 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate at tier 2. If so, choose whichever low-power ability wasn’t gained at tier 1.

<!-- P, ID: 062669 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062670 -->

One option should inflict additional damage when using the focus’s fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy. That could be as simple as an ability that offers an additional attack of that kind.

<!-- P, ID: 062671 -->

The other option should provide a method to temporarily neutralize a foe by disarming them, dazing or stunning them, slowing or holding them, or otherwise discombobulating them by using the focus’s fighting style, energy, or attitude, or when used against a chosen enemy.

<!-- P, ID: 062672 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages provided by the focus’s paradigm. Often, this includes training in a particular kind of attack. Alternatively, the ability might increase the advantages provided by achieving a certain combat status, such as gaining surprise.

<!-- P, ID: 062673 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier ability that inflicts damage. Alternatively, if focused on fighting a particular kind of foe, this ability might give the character a chance to completely neutralize, destroy, blind, or kill a singular target of up to level 3 (or higher, if the focus is on a singular foe).

<!-- P, ID: 062674 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062675 -->

One of the options should use the focus paradigm to inflict an exceptional amount of damage.

<!-- P, ID: 062676 -->

The other option could be a different way of inflicting damage, either using the focus paradigm or just dealing lots of damage in general (and relying on previous focus tier abilities to improve targeting). This could be against multiple targets if the first option was for a single target, to outright kill or neutralize a target (starting with level 4, but with guidance for using Effort to increase the level of the target), or to select yet another foe, make another attack, or get away in order to fight another day.

#### SUPPORT

<!-- P, ID: 062679 -->

Foci that allow a character to help others succeed, defend others, heal others who are hurt, and so on are support foci. Of course, most foci abilities are often used in aid of others, but support foci (such as Siphons Power) prioritize aiding, healing, and improving the character who takes the focus.

<!-- P, ID: 062680 -->

Support foci rely on a variety of methods to provide their help, including martial training used in defense, supernatural or sci-fi means of providing healing, or simply easing the cares of others through entertainment.

<!-- P, ID: 062681 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062682 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to provide support. For instance, someone with a focus that uses entertainment to help others would require an instrument or similar object in aid of their craft. Some foci in this category don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

<!-- P, ID: 062683 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** You can draw an attack without having to use an action at any point before the end of the next round.

<!-- P, ID: 062684 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** You can take an extra action in aid of an ally.

<!-- P, ID: 062685 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062686 -->

- Defends the Weak
- Entertains
- Helps Their Friends
- Metes Out Justice
- Shepherds the Community
- Siphons Power
- Works Miracles

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062703 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that provides some form of defense, aid or entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection. That defense or protection could be to the PC and not to an ally, as one cannot protect another without first being able to protect themselves (and sometimes protecting themselves is the entire point).

<!-- P, ID: 062704 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. Often, this is an ability that grants skill training in a related area of knowledge or a related skill, but it might be something that works with the initial ability that, by itself, wouldn’t do much.

<!-- P, ID: 062705 -->

**Tier 2:** Choose a low-tier ability that follows up on the support style opened in the previous tier. If the previous tier’s ability provided a means of protection only for the focus taker, this tier 2 ability should specifically provide aid to another. If the previous tier specifically provided aid to another, this tier 2 ability could defend the focus taker or provide an offensive capability grounded, if possible, in the focus’s theme.

<!-- P, ID: 062706 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062707 -->

One option should work within the focus’s theme to aid, heal, protect, or otherwise help another.

<!-- P, ID: 062708 -->

The other option should be something that benefits the character, either an offensive or defensive ability, or something that broadens their expertise in some fashion. Alternatively, it could be another, different method of helping someone else.

<!-- P, ID: 062709 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that gives an ally a direct boon or provides the character with a way to help another. It could also be an ability that harms or nullifies a foe, as removing foes certainly helps allies.

<!-- P, ID: 062710 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier ability that provides an offensive or defensive option for the character, if none have been provided yet. If this need has been previously addressed or is deemed unnecessary, choose a high-tier ability that provides some form of defense, aid or entertainment, benefit to recovery or healing, or protection to another. For example, a tier 5 ability might grant an ally an additional free action or allow them to repeat a failed action.

<!-- P, ID: 062711 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062712 -->

One of the options should provide an ultimate method of helping another in the theme of the focus.

<!-- P, ID: 062713 -->

The other option could provide an alternative ultimate method of helping another; many foci in this category do. However, an option that provides high-tier offense or defense is also completely reasonable.

#### TANK COMBAT

<!-- P, ID: 062716 -->

Foci that prioritize being able to take a lot of punishment and soak up excess damage from foes fall within the tank combat category. These foci provide offensive abilities too, as well as additional abilities related to the particular method by which improved protection is achieved, but defensive abilities are most pronounced.

<!-- P, ID: 062717 -->

Some tank combat foci involve a physical transformation that grants additional protection, and others rely on specialized training, use tools like shields or heavy armor, or provide the ability to heal incredibly fast. The kinds of physical transformation that a tank focus provides, if any, vary widely. A focus might turn a character’s skin to stone, reinforce their body with metal, turn them into a monstrous being, make them so big it becomes harder to hurt them, and so on.

<!-- P, ID: 062718 -->

**Connection:** Choose four relevant connections from the Focus Connections list.

<!-- P, ID: 062719 -->

**Additional Equipment:** Any object necessary to maintain a physical transformation (such as a tool for repair if partly robotic, a shield or other defensive tool used if skilled, or possibly some kind of amulet or serum). Some tank combat foci don’t require anything to gain or retain their benefits.

<!-- P, ID: 062720 -->

**Minor Effect Suggestions:** +2 to Armor for a few rounds.

<!-- P, ID: 062721 -->

**Major Effect Suggestions:** Regain 2 points to Might Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 062722 -->

The following are examples and not meant to provide a complete list of all possible foci in this category.

<!-- L, ID: 062723 -->

- Abides in Stone
- Brandishes an Exotic Shield
- Defends the Gate
- Fuses Flesh and Steel
- Grows to Towering Heights
- Howls at the Moon
- Lives in the Wilderness
- Masters Defense
- Never Says Die
- Stands Like a Bastion

<!-- /L -->

##### Ability Selection Guidelines

<!-- P, ID: 062746 -->

**Tier 1:** Choose a low-tier ability that provides defense within the focus’s theme. If the theme is simply intense training or the use of a defensive tool, the ability might be as simple as a bonus to Armor. If protection comes from physical transformation, this ability provides the base form effects, benefits, and in some cases drawbacks for making the transformation. A low-tier enhanced healing ability would also be appropriate at first tier.

<!-- P, ID: 062747 -->

Sometimes an additional low-power ability is appropriate, depending on the focus. If the character transforms, this ability may provide a knock-on effect, though in the case of some transformations, it might be a description of how someone with an abnormal physiognomy can fully heal. Other times, the secondary power may simply be training in a related skill, or it may unlock the ability to use a particular armor or shield without penalty.

<!-- P, ID: 062748 -->

**Tier 2:** If the theme of the focus isn’t physical transformation, choose a low-tier ability that provides an additional method of defending, healing damage, or avoiding attacks.

<!-- P, ID: 062749 -->

If the theme of the focus is physical transformation, choose a low-tier ability that unlocks a new capability related to the form the character takes. That might mean gaining better control of the transformation, unlocking a robotic interface, or otherwise more fully unlocking that form. This ability is not necessarily defensive, though it could be.

<!-- P, ID: 062750 -->

**Tier 3:** Choose two mid-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062751 -->

One option should provide an additional form of protection in keeping with the focus’s theme, such as more defensive capabilities unlocked from a transformation (which might also come with additional offensive capabilities) or a simple physical enhancement if defense is gained by skills or enhanced healing.

<!-- P, ID: 062752 -->

The other option should provide an offensive capability, especially if creating a non-transformation focus that doesn’t already have offensive benefits. That capability could be an enhanced attack or provide some other benefit useful in combat, such as quickly evading or (on the other end of the continuum) becoming immovable.

<!-- P, ID: 062753 -->

**Tier 4:** Choose a mid-tier ability that further enhances the advantages provided by the focus’s damage-soaking paradigm. Often, this includes training in a particular kind of defense. Alternatively, it might increase the advantages provided by previously unlocked defensive abilities, whether that means gaining greater control over a transformation, gaining additional chances to avoid damage or retry tasks related to enhanced determination, and so on. If the focus is lacking in offensive options, this is a good place to include one.

<!-- P, ID: 062754 -->

**Tier 5:** Choose a high-tier ability that provides protection, possibly in the form of shrugging off a debilitating condition (including death). If the focus offers a physical transformation, this ability might further unlock an additional related ability, whether offensive, defensive, or something related to exploration or interaction (such as flight if the form is winged, intimidation if the form is fearsome, and so on).

<!-- P, ID: 062755 -->

**Tier 6:** Choose two high-tier abilities. Give both of them as options for the focus; a PC will choose one or the other.

<!-- P, ID: 062756 -->

One option should use the focus paradigm to increase the defense, protection, or ability to shrug off damage.

<!-- P, ID: 062757 -->

The other option could be a different way of being defensive. In some cases, the best defense is a good offense, so this option could provide a high-tier offensive ability in keeping with the focus’s theme, whether that’s a straight-up damage boost on attacks or better control of an unstable physical transformation.
