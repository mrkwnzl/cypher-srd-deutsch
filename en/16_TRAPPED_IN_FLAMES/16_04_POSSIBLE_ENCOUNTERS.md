### POSSIBLE ENCOUNTERS

<!-- P, ID: 160034 -->

**Staying Put:** People from higher floors start coming down, alone or in small groups. Some of them claim to have information. Some of it is true and some isn’t. Things they might try to say include:

<!-- L, ID: 160035 -->

- A gas main broke, and not only is there a fire danger, but the building is also filling with gas. (This is false.)
- This is a terror attack! We have to get out of here at any cost! (This is true, although this NPC has no evidence or details, and the hysterical panic they feel probably doesn’t help.)
- Something crashed into the building! (This is false.)
- Terrorists are in the building, killing and kidnapping people. (This is false, for the most part. There’s just one bomber, and he’s trying to sneak out.)
- Rescue teams are on their way up. (This is false.)
- Rescue teams are landing evacuation helicopters on the roof. (This is false. It might be a tactic they try eventually, but it’s not happening yet.)

Most of the NPCs coming down from above continue down the stairs to lower floors, with or without the PCs.

> **Checking cell phones:** PCs can reach their loved ones at first, although this provides no real information. If they’re able to get through to emergency services, they are told that emergency responders are on their way and to stay put. It’s too soon to get much information from the internet, although a few minutes after it happens, there are reports of an explosion in the building on either floor 10 or floor 12. Building Wi-Fi is down. Data and phone usage becomes spotty about five minutes after the explosion and can’t be relied upon.

**Going Up a Stairwell to the Roof:** There is a pregnant person on the stairway who can’t be moved. Helping them deliver the baby safely is a difficulty 3 Intellect-based task and will take about twenty minutes.

<!-- P, ID: 160052 -->

**Reaching the Roof:** There are a few other people on the roof, but no rescue workers. Eventually, a small helicopter flies overhead, and if the bomber is not visibly present, it will circle but not land. This is the terrorist’s accomplice in a small two-person helicopter. The pilot is level 3 and has body armor (+2 Armor), a handgun, and a knife. If the bomber is present, the helicopter will land very briefly to try to rescue him.

<!-- P, ID: 160053 -->

**Going Down a Stairwell:** The PCs hear cries for help as they pass by a floor. If they investigate, they find an office close to the stairs where someone is trapped underneath a very heavy shelving unit. It is a difficulty 4 task to rescue them. They are level 2 and their leg is quite injured.

<!-- P, ID: 160054 -->

**Going Further Down the Stairwell:** Three people stand in the stairwell and tell the PCs to go back up. They say it’s not safe to try to evacuate, and the PCs should go back up to higher floors. They won’t take no for an answer. They will argue with the characters, and trying to win that argument is a difficulty 7 task. They will use force to back up their point—they won’t try to harm the PCs, but they will try to physically block the characters. Getting past them is a difficulty 5 task. Individually, they are each level 3.

<!-- P, ID: 160055 -->

**Going Even Further Down the Stairwell:** Smoke! The stairwell is quickly becoming a chimney, even before the PCs get close to the tenth floor. Visibility is almost nil (treat as complete darkness) and characters must succeed at Might defense rolls each round or suffer 2 points of damage and lose their next action. The difficulty level starts at 2 but increases by 1 every other round.

<!-- P, ID: 160056 -->

Fire! If the PCs descend to the eleventh floor, they find fire rages there (and it extends down to the ninth). The explosive(s) are incendiary and designed to start hot fires that can eventually bring the building down. Characters on thesefloors must make Speed defense rolls each round or suffer 6 points of damage. Even characters who succeed at their rolls suffer 3 points of damage from the heat, flames, smoke, and lack of oxygen.

<!-- P, ID: 160057 -->

**Firefighters to the Rescue:** Eventually, the firefighters make a clear and relatively safe path out of the building through one of the stairwells, and they work to get everyone out. This is a great time for one last GM intrusion, or for the PCs who have seen the bomber to spot him trying to sneak out posing as a victim—perhaps as they exit the building.
