### CHARACTER CREATION

<!-- P, ID: 160005 -->

The characters should be relatively mundane people. No supernatural powers. Cypher Short character suggestions include:

<!-- P, ID: 160006 -->

**Office Worker:** This is probably someone with the Sneaking type. The player should figure out the character’s name, a very short personality brief, what company they work for, and what their job is: data entry, customer service, accounts manager, and so on.

<!-- P, ID: 160007 -->

**Middle Manager:** This is probably someone with the Searching and Discovering type. The player should figure out the character’s name, a very short personality brief, and what company they work for.

<!-- P, ID: 160008 -->

**Salesperson:** The Talking type would work well for this character. The player should figure out the character’s name, a very short personality brief, and what company they work for.

<!-- P, ID: 160009 -->

**Custodial Worker:** This could be a Performing Physical Actions character, or possibly a Searching and Discovering character. The player should figure out the character’s name and a very short personality brief. They have keys to most of the doors of the building and know the layout well. They might also have something like a mop and wheeled bucket, or a cart with various cleaning supplies, if the player wishes.

<!-- P, ID: 160010 -->

**Security Guard:** This is probably someone with the Performing Physical Actions type. The player should figure out the character’s name and a very short personality brief. They have a weapon (a nightstick, a taser, or perhaps a handgun), and keys to most of the doors in the building. They know the layout well.

> No one has any special equipment other than the typical: a cell phone, car keys, a half-drunk coffee, and maybe a briefcase with papers and pens or a tablet computer.

> All random people in the building are level 2 or 3 NPCs.
