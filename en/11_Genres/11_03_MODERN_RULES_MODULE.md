### MODERN RULES MODULE

<!-- P, ID: 110381 -->

The modern setting is easy because it’s just the real world, right? Well, yes and no. It’s easy for players to understand the context of a modern setting. They know the default assumptions—cities, cars, cell phones, the internet, and so on. It’s also easier for some players to get into character, because their character could be someone they might very well pass on the street. It can be easier to wrap your mind around a history professor than a thousand-year-old elf wizard. These things make it easier on the GM as well.

But for the same reason, it’s not easy. The setting is the real world we all know, so it’s easy to get facts wrong or let them bog you down. What happens when you pull the fire alarm on the thirty-fifth floor of a major hotel in a large city? How fast do the authorities arrive? In truth, the facts aren’t as important as the story you’re creating, but some verisimilitude is nice.

#### MOLDING CHARACTERS FOR A MODERN GAME

<!-- P, ID: 110385 -->

If you’re trying to portray a psychic with a few basic powers, you might not want to use the Adept character type. Instead, choose a different type (perhaps a Speaker) and encourage foci such as Commands Mental Powers or Focuses Mind Over Matter. Some of the Adept’s powers might be too over the top for the genre.

<!-- P, ID: 110386 -->

Similarly, the technology flavor is probably too high-tech for a modern game. For someone with technical skills, use the skills and knowledge flavor instead.

<!-- P, ID: 110387 -->

Sometimes, the types might be more physical than is always desirable for a modern game, but that’s because the least physical type, the Adept, is often inappropriate for other reasons. The Calm descriptor is very good for such characters, not only granting them a great deal of skill and knowledge, but also reducing their physical capabilities.

<!-- P, ID: 110388 -->

Last, don’t forget foci such as Doesn’t Do Much or Would Rather Be Reading for “normal” characters who have useful skills but not much in the way of flashy abilities.

#### OPTIONAL RULE: HANDLING PCs AS CHILDREN

<!-- P, ID: 110508 -->

The regular character creation process makes fully competent, adult characters. To account for playing children, the GM could adopt this optional rule. First, the players make their characters normally, and then they apply the following adjustments to their PCs, as appropriate to their age category. You might also consider applying a tier cap of 3 to childhood adventure games with kids of up to thirteen years old, and a tier cap of 4 for childhood adventure games featuring PCs who are aged fourteen to seventeen.

##### AGE 9 TO 13

<!-- P, ID: 110511 -->

**Slight:** –4 to your Might Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 110512 -->

**Vulnerable:** Adults look out for you. You are trained in all pleasant social interactions with adults.

<!-- P, ID: 110513 -->

**Inability:** Might-based tasks are hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 110514 -->

**Inability:** Tasks involving knowledge are hindered.

##### AGE 14 TO 17

<!-- P, ID: 110517 -->

**Youthful:** –2 to your Might Pool.

<!-- P, ID: 110518 -->

**Inability:** Tasks involving knowledge are hindered.
