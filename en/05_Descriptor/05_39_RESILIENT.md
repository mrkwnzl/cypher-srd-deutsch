<!-- P, ID: 050804 -->

You can take a lot of punishment, both physically and mentally, and still come back for more. It takes a lot to put you down. Neither physical nor mental shocks or damage have a lasting effect. You’re tough to faze. Unflappable. Unstoppable.

You gain the following characteristics:

**Resistant:** +2 to your Might Pool, and +2 to your Intellect Pool.
