### Fantasy Character Options

<!-- P, ID: 030848 -->

In some cases, the ideas here require minor changes to the flavor described in the character options; you should work with your GM to make sure these changes are suitable for the campaign. Most of the foci in this section appear in the Cypher System; foci with an asterisk (\*) are found later in this document. Some of these options recommend swapping out a type ability for an ability from one of the character flavors such as combat, magic, or stealth.

**Alchemist:** In the sense that an alchemist is someone who makes magical items or similar types of things, Adept and Explorer are appropriate type choices for academic alchemists. For a general sort of alchemist who makes potions of magical effects, choose the Masters Spells focus (instead of spells, you learn potions). For one who transforms into a powerful and dangerous creature, choose Howls at the Moon. For one who loves throwing bombs, choose Bears a Halo of Fire. For a healer, choose Works Miracles.

<!-- P, ID: 030850 -->

**Assassin/Spy:** Explorer and Warrior are good type choices for an assassin character. Appropriate foci are Masters Weaponry, Moves Like a Cat, Murders, and Works the Back Alleys.

<!-- P, ID: 030851 -->

**Barbarian:** A barbarian character is probably a Warrior or (to focus a little more on skills than combat) an Explorer. Good foci to choose from are Lives in the Wilderness, Masters Weaponry, Needs No Weapon, Never Says Die, Performs Feats of Strength, and Rages.

<!-- P, ID: 030852 -->

**Bard:** Bards in fantasy fiction and games are troubadours, minstrels, and storytellers, perhaps with a supernatural element. Bards are usually Explorers or Speakers. Appropriate foci are Entertains, Helps Their Friends, Infiltrates, and Masters Spells.

<!-- P, ID: 030853 -->

**Cleric or Priest:** Academic clerics are usually Adepts or Speakers, but martial clerics are often Warriors (perhaps with magic flavor). For a typical cleric with a versatile set of abilities, choose the Channels Divine Blessings focus.

<!-- L, ID: 030854 -->

- _Cleric (death):_ Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits
- _Cleric (knowledge):_ Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Would Rather Be Reading
- _Cleric (life):_ Defends the Weak, Shepherds the Community, Works Miracles
- _Cleric (light):_ Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings
- _Cleric (storm):_ Rides the Lightning, Thunders
- _Cleric (trickery):_ Takes Animal Shape\* (also see options for rogues)
- _Cleric (war):_ Masters Weaponry (also see options for fighters)

**Druid:** As a very specific sort of nature priest, a druid character is usually an Adept or Explorer (in either case probably using the magic flavor). A typical druid probably has Channels Divine Blessings or Lives in the Wilderness as a focus, but for more specific options, see the following foci:

<!-- L, ID: 030870 -->

- _Druid (animal companion):_ Controls Beasts, Masters the Swarm
- _Druid (elemental):_ Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice
- _Druid (nature affinity):_ Speaks for the Land
- _Druid (transformation):_ Abides in Stone, Takes Animal Shape\*, Walks the Wild Woods\*

<!-- /L -->

<!-- P, ID: 030879 -->

**Fighter:** Fighters almost always have the Warrior type, but some are Explorers. A typical fighter probably has a direct focus like Masters Weaponry or Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*. For additional options based on choosing a specific fighting role, see the following:

<!-- L, ID: 030880 -->

- _Fighter (guardian):_ Brandishes an Exotic Shield, Defends the Gate, Masters Defense, Never Says Die, Stands Like a Bastion.
- _Fighter (melee):_ Fights Dirty, Fights With Panache, Looks For Trouble, Needs No Weapon, Wields Two Weapons at Once
- _Fighter (ranged):_ Is Licensed to Carry, Throws With Deadly Accuracy

<!-- /L -->

<!-- P, ID: 030887 -->

**Gunslinger:** A gunslinger is probably a Warrior or Explorer, but some are Speakers with combat flavor. Appropriate foci are Is Licensed to Carry, Masters Weaponry, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*.

<!-- P, ID: 030888 -->

**Inquisitor:** Inquisitors are usually Explorers, Speakers, or Warriors, depending on whether their inclinations are for having many skills, being good at interacting with people, or combat. Appropriate foci are Infiltrates, Metes Out Justice, and Operates Undercover.

<!-- P, ID: 030889 -->

**Merchant:** An Explorer with a focus dealing with social interactions, like Entertains or Leads, would make a good merchant character, but the more obvious choice would be a Speaker.

<!-- P, ID: 030890 -->

**Monk or Martial Artist:** As masters of unarmed combat, monks are usually Warriors or Explorers (perhaps with a combat flavor). Appropriate foci are Fights With Panache, Needs No Weapon, and Throws With Deadly Accuracy.

<!-- P, ID: 030891 -->

**Paladin/Holy Knight/Paragon:** As holy warriors who mix martial prowess and magic, paladins are usually Warriors or Explorers (in either case, perhaps modified with the magic flavor). Good foci for this type of character include Defends the Gate, Defends the Weak, Metes Out Justice, Slays Monsters, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*.

<!-- P, ID: 030892 -->

**Ranger:** Rangers mix combat and skills, and therefore are usually Explorers (perhaps with combat flavor) or Warriors (perhaps with skills and knowledge flavor). Appropriate foci for a ranger are Controls Beasts, Hunts, Lives in the Wilderness, Slays Monsters, Throws With Deadly Accuracy, and Wields Two Weapons at Once.

<!-- P, ID: 030893 -->

**Rogue or Thief:** Most rogue-type characters are Explorers, but an interaction-focused rogue could easily be a Speaker (perhaps with stealth flavor). Good foci for rogues are Explores Dark Places, Fights Dirty, Hunts, Infiltrates, Is Wanted by the Law, Moves Like a Cat, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Works the Back Alleys.

<!-- P, ID: 030894 -->

**Sorcerer:** Sorcerers, for our purpose here, are mages who have inherent magical abilities (as opposed to wizards, who study long and hard to get their spells). Most sorcerers are Adepts, but some are Explorers or Speakers. The Masters Spells focus gives a typical sorcerer an effective set of abilities, and most foci choices provide a themed set of spells. For sorcerers of various magical bloodlines, see the following:

<!-- L, ID: 030895 -->

- _Sorcerer (angel):_ Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings, Keeps a Magic Ally
- _Sorcerer (destiny):_ Descends From Nobility, Was Foretold
- _Sorcerer (dragon):_ Bears a Halo of Fire, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice
- _Sorcerer (elemental):_ Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Employs Magnetism, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice
- _Sorcerer (fey):_ Takes Animal Shape\*
- _Sorcerer (fiend):_ Bears a Halo of Fire, Keeps a Magic Ally
- _Sorcerer (undead):_ Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits

**Trickster or Con Artist:** These clever folks are typically Speakers, although they could be Adepts if they are very magical (or Explorers if they aren’t magical at all). Foci choices include Fights Dirty, Works the Back Alleys, or Entertains.

<!-- P, ID: 030911 -->

**War-wizard:** For those unusual characters who use a mix of weapon attacks and spells, play a Warrior with magic flavor or an Expert with combat or magic flavor. Appropriate foci include Fights With Panache, Masters Weaponry, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon\*.

<!-- P, ID: 030912 -->

**Warlock or Witch:** For the purposes of this list, warlocks and witches are mages who gain magical power from pacts they make with otherworldly entities. Most warlocks are Adepts, but Explorers and Speakers (perhaps with magic flavor) can be interesting options. Fun foci for a warlock include Dances With Dark Matter, Keeps a Magic Ally, Masters the Swarm, Separates Mind From Body, and Was Foretold, but (depending on the patron and pact) most sorcerer and wizard foci work just as well.

<!-- P, ID: 030913 -->

**Wild Mage:** Those who use chaotic magic are usually Adepts, but a dabbler might be an Explorer or Speaker with the magic flavor. The best focus that suits this theme is Uses Wild Magic\*.

<!-- P, ID: 030914 -->

**Wizard:** For the purposes of this list, wizards study magical lore at length to learn the ways of spellcasting (as opposed to sorcerers, warlocks, and so on). Wizards are usually Adepts, but a person-oriented wizard might be a Speaker (perhaps with the magic flavor). For a generalist wizard who has a variety of spells, choose the Masters Spells focus. For more specific kinds of wizards, see the following:

<!-- L, ID: 030915 -->

- _Wizard (abjurer):_ Absorbs Energy, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Wears a Sheen of Ice
- _Wizard (conjurer or summoner):_ Controls Beasts, Keeps a Magic Ally
- _Wizard (diviner):_ Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Separates Mind From Body, Solves Mysteries
- _Wizard (enchanter):_ Commands Mental Powers, Leads
- _Wizard (evoker):_ Bears a Halo of Fire, Blazes With Radiance, Rides the Lightning, Thunders, Wears a Sheen of Ice
- _Wizard (illusionist):_ Awakens Dreams, Crafts Illusions
- _Wizard (necromancer):_ Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits
- _Wizard (transmuter):_ Controls Gravity, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Takes Animal Shape\*

#### Prepared vs. Spontaneous Spellcasting

<!-- P, ID: 030934 -->

Magical characters get their abilities (which might be spells, rituals, or something else) from their type and focus, and they can use these abilities as they see fit as long as they spend the required Pool points. This technically makes them more like spontaneous casters. If you’d like to play something more like a prepared-caster wizard with a large selection of abilities that you narrow down each day, consider a spellcasting-oriented focus like Channels Divine Blessings, Masters Spells, or Speaks for the Land, and consider augmenting it with the optional spellcasting rule.
