### Further Customization

<!-- P, ID: 030937 -->

The rules in this section are more advanced and always involve the GM. They can be used by the GM to tailor a type to better fit the genre or setting, or by a player and a GM to tweak a character to fit a concept.

#### Modifying Type Aspects

<!-- P, ID: 030940 -->

The following aspects of the four character types can be modified at character creation. Other abilities should not be changed.

<!-- P, ID: 030941 -->

**Stat Pools:** Each character type has a starting stat Pool value. A player can exchange points between their Pools on a one-for-one basis. For example, they can trade 2 points of Might for 2 points of Speed. However, no starting stat Pool should be higher than 20.

**Edge:** A player can start with an Edge of 1 in whichever stat they wish.

<!-- P, ID: 030943 -->

**Cypher Use:** If a character gives up the ability to bear one cypher, they gain an additional skill of their choice.

<!-- P, ID: 030944 -->

**Weapons:** Some types have static first-tier abilities that let them use light, medium, and/or heavy weapons without a penalty. Warriors can use all weapons, Explorers can use light and medium weapons, and Adepts and Speakers can use light weapons. Any one of these weapon abilities can be sacrificed to gain training in a different skill of the player’s choice.

#### Drawbacks and Penalties

<!-- P, ID: 030947 -->

In addition to other customization options, a player can choose to take drawbacks or penalties to gain further advantages.

<!-- P, ID: 030948 -->

**Weakness:** A weakness is, essentially, the opposite of Edge. If you have a weakness of 1 in Speed, all Speed actions that require you to spend points cost 1 additional point from your Pool. At any time, a player can give their character a weakness in one stat and, in exchange, gain +1 to their Edge in one of the other two stats. So a PC can take a weakness of 1 in Speed to gain +1 to their Might Edge.

<!-- P, ID: 030949 -->

Normally, you can have a weakness only in a stat in which you have an Edge of 0. Further, you can’t have more than one weakness, and you can’t have a weakness greater than 1 unless the additional weakness comes from another source (such as a disease or disability arising from actions or conditions in the game).

<!-- P, ID: 030950 -->

**Inabilities:** Inabilities are like negative skills. They make one type of task harder by hindering it. If a character chooses to take an inability, they gain a skill of their choice. Normally, a character can have only one inability unless the additional inability comes from another source (such as a descriptor or a disease or disability arising from actions or conditions in the game).
