### CHARACTER CREATION

<!-- P, ID: 150016 -->

Cypher Shorts use an abbreviated character creation system, even simpler than the standard Cypher System. This is to help players move quickly, without spending a lot of time deciding between this focus and that one.

<!-- P, ID: 150017 -->

The following character creation guidelines are very broad, designed to work with any genre or situation. In a specific Cypher Short, it’s likely that only the type choices will be detailed, using the information here as a starting point. Descriptors and foci are general enough that they’ll work with almost any scenario. Sometimes, though, a Cypher Short might require adjustments to suit the situation.

<!-- P, ID: 150018 -->

Just like in the standard system, characters end up with a sentence to describe themselves: “I am a [blank] [blank] who [blanks].” All players start with a score of 9 in their stat Pools, with 6 points to divide among them as they wish. They have an Edge of 1 in a stat of their choosing. Recovery rolls are 1d6 + 1, and characters have an Effort of 1. (Otherwise, don’t worry about tier.)

<!-- P, ID: 150019 -->

All characters start with 1 XP.

#### DESCRIPTORS

<!-- P, ID: 150022 -->

A descriptor quickly and easily distinguishes the character from the others. Ideally, no two players have the same descriptor.

<!-- P, ID: 150023 -->

**Tough:** Add +3 to Might Pool. You are trained in Might defense rolls.

<!-- P, ID: 150024 -->

**Quick:** Add +3 to Speed Pool. You are trained in Speed defense rolls.

<!-- P, ID: 150025 -->

**Smart:** Add +3 to Intellect Pool. You are trained in Intellect defense rolls.

<!-- P, ID: 150026 -->

**Skilled:** Add +1 to Intellect Pool and choose three skills in which you are trained. These skills cannot be related to combat or interaction.

<!-- P, ID: 150027 -->

**Charming:** Add +2 to Intellect Pool. You are trained in persuasion and deception.

#### TYPES

<!-- P, ID: 150030 -->

This is the role the character will have in the story. Types will likely change from genre to genre, particularly the type names. So in this section, we’ll talk about them in terms of the general role the character will have in the story, not what players will write on their character sheet (although a few example suggestions are provided).

##### Wielding Supernatural Powers

<!-- P, ID: 150085 -->

This type isn’t suited to all scenarios, obviously—it depends on the genre. This character might be called a Psychic, a Wizard, a Superhero, or a Mutant (just to name a few), depending on the situation. The player and GM will have to briefly work out the specifics together. Choose two of the following abilities:

<!-- L, ID: 150086 -->

- Possess one offensive power (mental attacks, ray blasts, starting things on fire, and so on) that affects foes up to long range and either deals up to 4 points of damage or causes them to lose their next action. Costs 3 stat points (probably Intellect).
- Possess one defensive power (force field, metal skin, super speed, and so on) that either grants you +3 Armor or eases defensive tasks.
- Possess one miscellaneous power (moving things with your mind, flight, creating a duplicate of yourself, and so on). Costs 3 stat points (probably Intellect). You’ll have to come up with some reasonable parameters. You can choose this option twice.
- Have two power shifts.
- Have another power shift.

#### FOCUS

<!-- P, ID: 150099 -->

A focus determines the actions a character might often take in the story.

<!-- P, ID: 150100 -->

**Fights:** You’re a fighter. All of your attacks are eased, and you add +1 to your damage.

<!-- P, ID: 150101 -->

**Plans:** You think things through. You are trained in defense rolls, and you can choose two other noncombat skills in which you are trained.

<!-- P, ID: 150102 -->

**Helps:** You help other characters. You can use an action to ease everyone else’s action if they’re within short range (costs 2 Intellect points). This can represent comforting, giving advice, or physically enabling them, depending on the character and the situation. You’re trained in first aid.

<!-- P, ID: 150103 -->

**Provides Information:** You’re very knowledgeable. You are trained in three knowledge-based skills (history, biology, geography, and so on). You can ask the GM a question that has a pretty simple answer and get that answer (costs 3 Intellect points).

<!-- P, ID: 150104 -->

**Provides Comedy Relief:** You’re funny. You can use an action to allow everyone to recover 2 points to their Pools in between each recovery action you take. You’re also trained in Speed defense and stealth.

<!-- P, ID: 150105 -->

**Works With Tools (or Machines):** You’re trained in the use of two different skills involving tools and machines. You can modify an existing machine or device to do something other than its original function (costs 2 Intellect points).

<!-- P, ID: 150106 -->

**Uses Powers:** This focus won’t fit every genre. You can choose one of the abilities listed under the Wielding Supernatural Powers type. (Note: if that is already your type, you can’t select an ability you’ve already chosen, with the exception of miscellaneous powers.)
