### Abilities—N

<!-- P, ID: 073343 -->

**Natural Charisma:** You are trained in all social interactions, whether they involve charm, learning a person’s secrets, or intimidating others. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073344 -->

**Natural Crafter:** All commonplace objects or structures you craft are effectively one level higher than an average example of that object or structure. For instance, if you craft a defensive wall that would normally be level 4, its effective level is 5. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073345 -->

**Necromancy (3+ Intellect points):** You animate the body of a dead creature of approximately your size or smaller, creating a level 1 creature. It has none of the intelligence, memories, or special abilities that it had in life. The creature follows your verbal commands for one hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the creature is killed by damage, you can reanimate it again when its time expires, but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly reanimated state. If you have access to multiple bodies, you can create an additional undead creature for each additional Intellect point you spend when you activate the ability. Action to animate.

<!-- P, ID: 073346 -->

**Negate Danger (7 Intellect points):** You permanently negate a source of potential danger related to one creature or object within immediate distance. This could be a weapon or device held by someone, a creature’s natural ability, or a trap triggered by a pressure plate. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073347 -->

**Negotiate (3 Intellect points):** In any gathering where two or more people are trying to establish the truth or come to a decision, you can sway the verdict with masterful rhetoric. If you are given a few rounds or more to argue your point, either the decision goes your way or, if someone else effectively argues a competing point, any associated persuasion or deception task is eased by two steps. Action to initiate, one or more rounds to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 073348 -->

**Network Tap (4 Intellect points):** You can ask the GM one question and get a very short answer if you succeed on an Intellect roll against a difficulty assigned by the GM. The more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. On a failed roll, feedback or perhaps some defense from the network you’re accessing inflicts 4 points of Intellect damage on you (ignores Armor). Action. (Generally, knowledge that you could find by looking somewhere other than your current location is level 1, while obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible.)

<!-- P, ID: 073349 -->

**Never Fumble:** If you roll a natural 1 when attacking with your chosen weapon, you can ignore or countermand the GM intrusion for that roll. You can never be disarmed of your chosen weapon, nor will you ever drop it accidentally. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073350 -->

**Nightmare (5 Intellect points):** You pull a horrifying creature from your worst nightmare into the waking world and sic it on your foes. The nightmare (level 5) persists each round while you use your action concentrating on it (or until you disperse it or it is destroyed). It has one of the following abilities, which you choose when you call it.

<!-- P, ID: 073351 -->

_Confusion._ Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare’s attack confuses the target for one round. On its next action, the target attacks an ally.

<!-- P, ID: 073352 -->

_Horrify._ Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare’s attack horrifies the target, which drops to its knees (or similar appendages). The target takes 3 points of damage that ignore Armor and is dazed for one round, during which time all its tasks are hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 073353 -->

_Pustule Eruption._ Instead of making a normal attack, the nightmare’s attack causes rancid, painful pustules to rise all over the target’s skin for one minute. If the target takes a forceful action (such as attacking another creature or moving farther than an immediate distance), the pustules burst, dealing 5 points of damage that ignore Armor.

<!-- P, ID: 073354 -->

Action to initiate, action each round to concentrate.

<!-- P, ID: 073355 -->

**Nightstrike:** When you attack a foe in dim light or darkness, you get a free level of Effort on the attack. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073356 -->

**Nimble Swimmer:** You are trained in all defense actions while underwater. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073357 -->

**No Need for Weapons:** When you make an unarmed attack (such as a punch or kick), it counts as a medium weapon instead of a light weapon. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073358 -->

**No One Knows Better:** You are trained in two of the following skills: persuasion, deception, intimidation, research, knowledge in one area, or seeing through deception. If you choose a skill in which you’re already trained, you become specialized in that skill instead. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073359 -->

**Noble’s Courage (3+ Intellect points):** Your noble lineage teaches that courage is necessary to do things that are difficult, tedious, or dangerous. When your mind would be negatively affected by an effect of up to level 4, whether something as overt as a psychic command or illness or something as subtle as fear or even boredom, your courage neutralizes the effect for up to a minute or, if you’re actively being attacked, until the next attack. For each level of Effort applied, you can increase the level of the effect you can neutralize by 1. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073360 -->

**Not Dead Yet:** When you would normally be dead, you instead fall unconscious for one round and then awaken. You immediately gain 1d6 + 6 points to restore your stat Pools, and you are treated as if debilitated until you rest for ten hours. If you die again before you make your ten-hour recovery roll, you are truly dead. If you also have this ability from another source, your healing from this ability increases to 1d6 + 12. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073361 -->

**Nothing but Defend:** If you do nothing on your turn but defend, you are specialized in all defense tasks for one round. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073362 -->

**Nullify Sound (3 Might points):** You pulse perfectly misaligned sounds within short range to create a zone of absolute quiet up to an immediate distance across for one minute. All sound is canceled in the zone. Action to initiate.
