### Abilities—Q

<!-- P, ID: 073468 -->

**Quarry (2 Intellect points):** Choose a quarry (a single individual creature that you can see). You are trained in all tasks involving following, understanding, interacting with, or fighting that creature. You can have only one quarry at a time. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073469 -->

**Question the Spirits (2 Intellect points):** You can call a spirit to you and petition it to answer a few questions (usually no more than three before the spirit fades).

<!-- P, ID: 073470 -->

First, you must summon a spirit. If it is a spirit of the dead, you must have personally known the creature, have an object that was owned by the creature, or touch the physical remains of the creature. For other spirits, you must know the spirit’s full name or have a great deal of an element (such as fire or earth) that the spirit is associated with.

<!-- P, ID: 073471 -->

If the spirit responds, it can manifest as an insubstantial shade that answers for itself, it can inhabit an object or any remains you provide, or it can manifest as an invisible presence that you speak for.

<!-- P, ID: 073472 -->

The spirit may not wish to answer your questions, in which case you must persuade it to help. You can attempt to psychically wrestle the spirit into submission (an Intellect task), or you can try diplomacy, deception, or blackmail (“Answer me, or I’ll tell your children that you were a philanderer” or “I’ll destroy this relic that belonged to you”).

The GM determines what the spirit might know, based on the knowledge it possessed in life. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073474 -->

**Quick Block:** If you use a light or medium weapon, you are trained in Speed defense tasks. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073475 -->

**Quick Death (2 Speed points):** You know how to kill quickly. When you hit with a melee or ranged attack, you deal 4 additional points of damage. You can’t make this attack in two consecutive rounds. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073476 -->

**Quick Recovery:** Your second recovery roll (usually requiring ten minutes) is only a single action. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073477 -->

**Quick Strike (4 Speed points):** You make a melee attack with such speed that it is hard for your foe to defend against, and it knocks them off balance. Your attack is eased by two steps, and the foe, if struck, takes normal damage but is dazed so that their tasks are hindered for the next round. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073478 -->

**Quick Study:** You learn from repetitive actions. You gain a +1 bonus to rolls for similar tasks after the first time (such as operating the same device or making attacks against the same foe). Once you move on to a new task, the familiarity with the old task fades—unless you start doing it again. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073479 -->

**Quick Switch:** You can activate Shrink as part of another action (the ability is now an enabler for you instead of an action). While the one-minute duration of Shrink is active, on your turn you can change size once before taking an action and once after taking an action. For example, on your turn you could change to small size, make an attack, and then return to your normal size, or you could change to your normal size, use your action to move a short distance, and then return to small size. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073480 -->

**Quick Throw (2 Speed points):** After using a thrown light weapon, you draw another light weapon and make another thrown attack against the same target or a different one. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073481 -->

**Quick to Flee:** You are trained in stealth and movement tasks. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073482 -->

**Quick Wits:** When performing a task that would normally require spending points from your Intellect Pool, you can spend points from your Speed Pool instead. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073483 -->

**Quick Work (3+ Intellect points):** One use of any artifact (or one minute of its continuous function) is increased by one level if you use it within the next minute. If you spend 4 additional Intellect points, the use is increased by two levels if you use it within the next minute. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073484 -->

**Quicker Than Most:** Experience has honed your reaction times, because those who act first gain the advantage in most situations. You’re trained in tasks related to initiative, seeing underlying patterns, and solving puzzles. Enabler.
