<!-- P, ID: 073823 -->

**Vacuum Skilled:** You are trained in two of the following skills: vacuum welding, algae farming, ecosystem design, circuit design, spacecraft maintenance and repair, or some similar skill related to traveling and colonizing planets, moons, and stations located in the solar system. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073824 -->

**Vanish (2 Intellect points):** You become invisible for a short amount of time. While invisible, you have an asset on stealth and Speed defense tasks. The invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073825 -->

**Verbal Misdirection (2+ Intellect points):** With fast talk and bewildering words, you can confuse and distract anyone that you’re speaking with, giving you an asset on social interactions with that person for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect additional creatures (one per level of Effort). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073826 -->

**Versatile Mind:** When you make a Speed defense roll, you can use your Intellect in place of your Speed. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073827 -->

**Very Long Sprinting:** When you use Phase Sprint, you can travel up to a very long distance as your action instead of a long distance. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073828 -->

**Vigilance (2 Intellect points):** You take a cautious approach to combat, focusing more on protecting yourself than on hurting your opponents. While this ability is active, you gain an asset on Speed defense rolls against melee and ranged attacks, and your melee and ranged attacks are hindered. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking place within range of your senses. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073829 -->

**Vigilant (5 Might points):** When affected by an attack or effect that would daze or stun you, you are not dazed or stunned. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073830 -->

**Vindictive Performance (5 Intellect points):** When you tell a joke, perform a song or poem, draw a picture, relate an anecdote, or otherwise provide entertainment, you can select one individual from the audience who is able to understand you. During your performance, you heap indirect but biting derision on this target. If you succeed, the target doesn’t realize that they’ve become the victim of your performance until you wrap up the entertainment at a moment you choose in a way that strikes home. The target suffers 6 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and loses their next turn. One or more actions to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073831 -->

**Void Wings (3 Intellect points):** Swirling ribbons of weird matter grasp you and lift you up, allowing you to fly for one round as quickly as you can move. Enabler.
