### Abilities—W

<!-- P, ID: 073834 -->

**Walk Through Walls (2 Intellect points):** You can slowly pass through physical barriers at a rate of 1 inch (2.5 cm) per round (minimum of one round to pass through any barrier). You can’t act (other than moving) or perceive anything until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can’t pass through energy barriers. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073835 -->

**Wall of Lightning (6 Intellect points):** You create a barrier of crackling electricity up to 2,500 square feet (230 sq. m) in size, shaped as you wish. The wall is a level 7 barrier. Anyone within immediate distance of the wall automatically takes 10 points of damage. The wall lasts for one hour. Action to create.

<!-- P, ID: 073836 -->

**Wall With Teeth:** You inflict 2 additional points of damage with all attacks when using your Living Wall ability. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073837 -->

**War Flesh:** You can instantly transform your hands and feet into claws, and your human teeth into fangs, or revert to your normal human appearance. When you make attacks with your claws or fangs, they count as medium weapons instead of light weapons. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073838 -->

**Ward:** You have a shield of energy around you at all times that helps deflect attacks. You gain +1 to Armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073839 -->

**Warding Shield:** You have +1 to Armor while you are using a shield. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073840 -->

**Water Adaptation:** You can breathe water as easily as you breathe air. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073841 -->

**Weapon and Body (5 Speed points):** After making a melee weapon or ranged weapon attack, you follow up with a punch or kick as an additional attack, all as part of the same action in one round. The two attacks can be directed at different foes. Make a separate attack roll for each attack. You remain limited by the amount of Effort you can apply on one action. Anything that modifies your attack or damage applies to both attacks, unless it is tied specifically to your weapon. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073842 -->

**Weapon Crafter:** You are trained in crafting tasks associated with your chosen weapon. For instance, if your weapon is a bow, you are trained in tasks related to crafting bows and fletching arrows; if your weapon is a sword, you are trained in tasks for forging swords and sharpening blades; and so on. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073843 -->

**Weapon Defense:** While your chosen weapon is in your hand(s), you are trained in Speed defense rolls. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073844 -->

**Weapon Master:** You inflict an additional 1 point of damage with your chosen weapon. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073845 -->

**Weaponization:** One light or medium melee weapon of your choice is built into your body, and you are trained in using it. The weapon is concealed until you wish to use it. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073846 -->

**Wear It Well:** When you wear armor of any kind, you gain an additional +1 to Armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073847 -->

**Weather the Vicissitudes:** Helping your friends means being able to stand up to everything the world throws at you. You have +1 to Armor. Also, you resist heat, cold, and similar extremes and have an additional +1 to Armor against ambient damage or other damage that would normally ignore Armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073848 -->

**Weight of the World (6+ Intellect points):** You can increase a target’s weight dramatically. The target is pulled to the ground and can’t move physically under its own power for one minute. The target must be within short range. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect additional creatures (one per level of Effort). Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073849 -->

**Weightless Shot:** You have a sixth sense when it comes to lining up trajectories and moving in low-gravity and zero-gravity environments, which also translates to making ranged attacks. When you hit a target with a ranged attack in microgravity conditions, you can choose to reduce the damage by 2 points but hit the target in a precise spot. Some of the possible effects include (but are not limited to) the following:

<!-- L, ID: 073850 -->

- You punch a hole in the target’s suit, so it begins to leak air into the vacuum slowly, or all at once (your choice).
- You hit the reaction mass of the target’s maneuvering pack, which means the target can no longer change their trajectory, or they go spinning off in a random direction (your choice).
- You can shoot a spacecraft, and degrade one ship system by one step (systems include engines, weapons, and atmosphere).

<!-- P, ID: 073857 -->

Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073858 -->

**Weighty (1 Intellect point):** You briefly increase the weight of a target within short range enough to stop them in their tracks, preventing the target from moving and hindering any attempted tasks on their next turn. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073859 -->

**Weird Science Breakthrough (5+ Intellect points):** Your research leads to a breakthrough, and you imbue an object with a truly amazing property, though you can use the item only once. To do so, you must buy spare parts equivalent to an expensive item, have a field science kit (or a permanent lab, if you have access to one), and succeed at a difficulty 4 Intellect-based roll to create a random manifest cypher of up to level 2. The GM decides the nature of the cypher you create. Attempting to create a specified cypher hinders the task by two steps. Creating a cypher does not allow you to surpass your normal cypher limit. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the cypher you create; each level of Effort increases the level of the cypher and the difficulty of the Intellect task to create it. Action to initiate, one hour to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 073860 -->

**Whirlwind of Throws (5 Speed points):** With a large handful of small objects—tiny knives, shuriken, stones, jagged bits of metal, coins, or whatever is on hand—you attack every creature in an immediate area within short range. You must make attack rolls against each target. Each attack is hindered. You inflict 3 points of damage on targets you hit. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073861 -->

**Wild Camouflage (4 Intellect points):** By drawing your clothing about you just so and using various tricks and your deep knowledge of your surroundings, you become invisible in the wilderness for ten minutes. While you are invisible, this asset eases your stealth and Speed defense tasks by two steps. This effect ends if you do something to reveal your presence or position—attacking, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, you can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding your position. Action to initiate or reinitiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073862 -->

**The Wild Is on Your Side (5 Intellect points):** While you’re in the wilderness, foes within short range are tripped by rocks, tangled in vines, bitten by insects, and distracted or confused by small animals, which hinders all their tasks for ten minutes. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073863 -->

**Wild Insight:** You gain a momentary perfect understanding of the flow of magic around you at this moment. When preparing your magic, choose one specific subtle cypher and make a magical lore skill roll against level 6. If you succeed, you gain that subtle cypher (the cypher’s level is 6); if you fail, you get a random subtle cypher. If you aren’t sure what specific subtle cypher you want, you can ask for a broad category such as “healing,” “movement,” or “skill”; this eases the magical lore task, and if you succeed, the GM chooses a random cypher that fits that category. You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour recovery action. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073864 -->

**Wild Vitality (4 Intellect points):** You attune with the life force of a natural creature (your size or bigger) within long range that you can see. This is a level 2 Intellect task. If you succeed, the creature is not harmed, but through resonance with its wild vitality, you gain several benefits for up to one minute: an asset to all your Might-based tasks (including attacks and defenses), +2 to your Might Edge and Speed Edge, and 2 additional points of damage on all successful melee attacks. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073865 -->

**Wildcard Powers:** You have a gift with using copied powers in unusual ways. Whenever you try a power stunt and use a level of Effort on the special roll to modify the ability, you get a free level of Effort on that roll. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073866 -->

**Wilderness Awareness (4 Intellect points):** Your connection to the natural world extends to a degree that some would call supernatural. While in the wilderness, you can extend your senses up to a mile in any direction and ask the GM a very simple, general question about that area, such as “Where is the orc camp?” or “Is my friend Deithan still alive?” If the answer you seek is not in the area, you receive no information. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073867 -->

**Wilderness Encouragement (3 Intellect points):** While in the wilderness, or when talking about your time in the wilderness, your stirring words of encouragement grant a target within short range that can understand you 1d6 points to one Pool. You can’t use this ability on the same creature again until they’ve made a recovery roll. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073868 -->

**Wilderness Explorer:** While taking any action (including fighting) in the wild, you ignore any penalties due to natural causes such as tall grass, thick brush, rugged terrain, weather, and so on. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073869 -->

**Wilderness Life:** You are trained in two of the following: climbing, swimming, navigation, or identifying plants and creatures. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073870 -->

**Wilderness Lore:** You are trained in wilderness navigation and in identifying plants and creatures. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073871 -->

**Will of a Leader (9 Intellect points):** You harden your allies’ dedication and capabilities. Each ally within immediate range gains +1 Edge to one stat of their choice for one hour. You also gain this benefit to one stat of your choice. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073872 -->

**Will of Legend:** You are immune to attacks that would captivate, mesmerize, charm, or otherwise influence your mind. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073873 -->

**Willing Sacrifice:** When you take an attack meant for another character, you know how to take the attack in a way that minimizes its effect. The attack automatically strikes you, but instead of taking 1 additional point of damage, you take 1 less point of damage (to a minimum of 1 point). Additionally, you can take more than one attack in a given round provided that all the attacks were originally meant for one target. Enabler.

<!-- H, ID: 073874 -->

> Two characters attempting to draw an attack at the same time cancel each other out.

<!-- P, ID: 073876 -->

**Wind Armor (1 Intellect point):** When you wish it, a cyclone of wind surrounds your body for ten minutes, giving you +1 to Armor and an additional +2 to Armor against physical projectile weapons specifically. While the cyclone is active, you feel no discomfort from the wind, and you can interact with other creatures and objects normally because the wind flow automatically diverts to enable such interaction. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073877 -->

**Wind Chariot (7+ Intellect points):** You summon winds that pick you up and allow you to fly for up to a long distance each round in combat or with an overland speed of up to 200 miles per hour (320 kph) for up to ten hours. For each level of Effort you apply, you can bring one ally of about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the effect by one hour. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073878 -->

**Windrider (4+ Intellect points):** You summon winds that pick you up and allow you to fly for one minute at a rate of up to a long distance each round. For each level of Effort you apply, you can carry one ally of about your size with you through the air or increase the duration of the effect by one minute. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073879 -->

**Windwracked Traveler (4+ Intellect points):** You condense a wide wing of dark matter that can carry you through the air for a period of up to one hour. For each level of Effort applied, you can add one hour to the duration or carry one additional creature of your size or smaller. You must touch the additional creatures for them to be tucked under your wing. They must remain relatively still while the wing lasts or they will fall. In terms of overland movement, you fly at about 20 miles (32 km) per hour and are not affected by terrain. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073880 -->

**Wings of Fire (4 Intellect points):** While your Shroud of Flame is active, you can spread wings of fire and can levitate, moving at a rate of up to 20 feet (6 m) per round in any direction for one minute. You can also take one other non-movement action on your turn. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073881 -->

**Wing Weapons:** You can use your wings to make melee attacks (even when flying), leaving your hands and feet free. Your wings are medium bashing or bladed weapons (your choice). You are practiced with this attack. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073882 -->

**Winter Gauntlets:** When you use Frost Touch, you inflict an additional 3 points of damage if you touch a creature, or an additional 2 points of damage if you infuse a weapon. In addition, damaged targets are frozen in place (if standing on a solid surface) and can’t move from their location until they use an action to break free. The target can still attack and defend. Action for touch; enabler for weapon.

<!-- P, ID: 073883 -->

**Wooden Body (1+ Might points):** You transform your body into living wood for ten minutes, which grants you several benefits. You gain +1 to Armor and you are practiced in using your limbs as medium weapons. You need about one-tenth as much air as a human. Hiding among trees or on a tree is eased. However, in your wooden form you move more stiffly than a creature of flesh, hindering your Speed defense rolls. Action to change or revert.

<!-- H, ID: 073884 -->

> Your wooden body might be smooth like a polished board, rough like tree bark, or a mix of both.

<!-- P, ID: 073886 -->

**Word of Command (6 Intellect points + level 6 cypher):** You utter a word so powerful that to fully invest it, you sacrifice a cypher in your possession that is level 6 or higher. You issue the word to one creature within long range that you can see. The affected target must obey the command for several hours before it is free to act as it wishes. Targets that are attacked while under the effect of the command can defend themselves. Typical commands include “retreat,” “calm,” “come,” and “stay.” The GM decides how the target acts once a command is given. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073887 -->

**Word of Death (5+ Intellect points):** Your attack is the utterance of a magic word so terrible that it snuffs the life from a living target within short range. The target must be level 1. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to kill a level 5 target (four levels above the normal limit), you must apply four levels of Effort. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073888 -->

**Work the Friendship (4 Intellect points):** You know just what to say to draw a little extra effort from an ally. This grants one creature you choose within short range an additional, immediate action, which it can take out of turn. The creature uses the additional action however it wishes. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073889 -->

**Wormhole (6 Intellect points):** You create a doorway through time and space. The shortcut manifests as a hole in reality large enough to accommodate you and creatures of your size or smaller. One side of the doorway appears anywhere within immediate range, and the other side opens at a spot you choose anywhere within long range. Any character or object moving into one side exits from the other. The door remains open for one minute or until you use an action to close it. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073890 -->

**Wound Tender:** You are trained in healing. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073891 -->

**Wraith Cloak:** At your command, the spirit from your Spirit Accomplice ability wraps itself around you for up to ten minutes. The spirit automatically inflicts 4 points of damage to anyone who tries to touch you or strike you with a melee attack. While the wraith cloak is active, all tasks to evade the perceptions of others are eased. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073892 -->

**Wreck:** Using two hands, you wield a weapon or a tool with a powerful swing. (If fighting unarmed, this attack is made with both fists or both feet together.) When using this as an attack, you take a –1 penalty to the attack roll, and you inflict 3 additional points of damage. When attempting to damage an object or barrier, you are trained in the task. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073893 -->

**Wrest From Chance:** If you roll a natural 1 on a d20, you can reroll the die. If you reroll, you avoid a GM intrusion—unless you roll a second 1—and might succeed on your task. Once you use this ability, it is not available again until after you make a ten-hour recovery roll. Enabler.
