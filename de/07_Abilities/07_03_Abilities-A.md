### Abilities—A

<!-- P, ID: 072481 -->

**A Smile and a Word:** When you use Effort on any action involving interactions—even those having to do with calming animals or communicating with someone or something whose language you do not speak—you gain a free level of Effort on the task. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072482 -->

**Able Assistance:** When you help someone with a task and they apply a level of Effort, they get a free level of Effort on that task. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072483 -->

**Absorb Energy (7 Intellect points):** You touch an object and absorb its energy. If you touch a manifest cypher, you render it useless. If you touch an artifact, roll for its depletion. If you touch another kind of powered machine or device, the GM determines whether its power is fully drained. In any case, you absorb energy from the object touched and regain 1d10 Intellect points. If this would give you more Intellect than your Pool’s maximum, the extra points are lost, and you must make a Might defense roll. The difficulty of the roll is equal to the number of points over your maximum you absorbed. If you fail the roll, you take 5 points of damage and are unable to act for one round. You can use this ability as a defense action when you’re the target of an incoming ability. Doing so cancels the incoming ability, and you absorb the energy as if it were a device. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072484 -->

**Absorb Kinetic Energy:** You absorb a portion of the energy of a physical attack or impact. You negate 1 point of damage you would have suffered and store that point as energy. Once you have absorbed 1 point of energy, you continue to negate 1 point of damage from any incoming blow or impact, but the residual energy bleeds off with a flare of harmless light (you cannot store more than 1 point at a time). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072485 -->

**Absorb Pure Energy:** When you use Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can also absorb and store energy from attacks made with pure energy (focused light, radiation, transdimensional, psychic, etc.) or from conduits that direct energy, if you can make direct contact. This ability does not change how many points of energy you can store. If you also have Improved Absorb Kinetic Energy, you can absorb 2 points of damage from other energy sources as well. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072486 -->

**Accelerate (4+ Intellect points):** Your words imbue the spirit of a character within immediate range who is able to understand you, accelerating them so they gain an asset on initiative tasks and Speed defense rolls for ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. You must speak to additional targets to accelerate them, one target per round. Action per target to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 072487 -->

**Acrobatic Attack (1+ Speed points):** You leap into the attack, twisting or flipping through the air. If you roll a natural 17 or 18, you can choose to have a minor effect rather than deal extra damage. If you apply Effort to the attack, you get a free level of Effort on the task. You can’t use this ability if your Speed Effort costs are reduced from wearing armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072488 -->

**Action Processor (4 Intellect points):** Drawing upon stored information and the ability to process incoming data at amazing speeds, you are trained in one physical task of your choice for ten minutes. For example, you can choose running, climbing, swimming, Speed defense, or attacks with a specific weapon. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 072489 -->

**Adaptation:** Thanks to a latent mutation, a device implanted in your spine, a ritual performed with dragon’s blood, or some other gift, you now remain at a comfortable temperature; never need to worry about dangerous radiation, diseases, or gases; and can always breathe in any environment (even the vacuum of space). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072490 -->

**Adroit Cypher Use:** You can bear four cyphers at a time. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072491 -->

**Advanced Command (7 Intellect points):** A target within short range obeys any command you give as long as they can hear and understand you. Further, as long as you continue to do nothing but issue commands (taking no other action), you can give that same target a new command. This effect ends when you stop issuing commands or they are out of short range. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 072492 -->

**Advantage to Disadvantage (3 Speed points):** With a number of quick moves, you make an attack against an armed foe, inflicting damage and disarming them so that their weapon is now in your hands or 10 feet (3 m) away on the ground—your choice. This disarming attack is hindered. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072493 -->

**Advantages of Being Big:** When you use Enlarge, you’re so big that you can move massive objects more easily, climb buildings by using hand- and footholds unavailable to regular-sized people, and jump much farther. While you enjoy the effects of Enlarge, all climbing, lifting, and jumping tasks are eased. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072494 -->

**Advantages of Being Small:** You’ve learned how to leverage your strength and accuracy in proportion to your size. Your damage is no longer halved when using Shrink, and climbing and jumping tasks are eased. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072495 -->

**Advice From a Friend (1 Intellect point):** You know your friend’s strengths and weaknesses, and how to motivate them to succeed. When you give an ally a suggestion involving their next action, the character is trained in that action for one round. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072496 -->

**Again and Again (8 Speed points):** You can take an additional action in a round in which you have already acted. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072497 -->

**Ageless:** Your body and mind do not age. Unless you are killed by violence (or some outside force such as poison or infection), you will never die. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072498 -->

**Agent Provocateur:** Choose one of the following to be trained in: attacking with a weapon of your choice, demolitions, or sneaking and lockpicking (if you choose this last option, you are trained in both). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072499 -->

**Aggression (2 Might points):** You focus on making attacks to such an extent that you leave yourself vulnerable to your opponents. While this ability is active, you gain an asset on your melee attacks, and your Speed defense rolls against melee and ranged attacks are hindered. This effect lasts for as long as you wish, but it ends if no combat is taking place within range of your senses. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072500 -->

**Agile Wit:** When attempting a Speed task, you instead can roll (and spend points) as if it were an Intellect action. If you apply Effort to this task, you can spend points from your Intellect Pool instead of your Speed Pool (in which case you also use your Intellect Edge instead of your Speed Edge). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072501 -->

**All-Out Con (7 Intellect points):** You put everything into it. You add three free levels of Effort to the next task you attempt. You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a ten-hour recovery action. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072502 -->

**Alleviate (3 Intellect points):** You attempt to cancel or cure one malady (such as disease or poison) in one creature. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072503 -->

**Alley Rat (6 Intellect points):** While in a city, you find or create a significant shortcut, secret entrance, or emergency escape route where it looked like none existed. Doing so requires that you succeed on an Intellect action whose difficulty is set by the GM based on the situation. You and the GM should work out the details. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072504 -->

**Always Tinkering:** If you have any tools and materials at all, and you are carrying fewer cyphers than your limit, you can create a manifest cypher if you have an hour of time to spend. The new cypher is random and always 2 levels lower than normal (minimum 1). It’s also temperamental and fragile. These are called temperamental cyphers. If you give one to anyone else to use, it falls apart immediately, useless. Action to initiate; one hour to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 072505 -->

**Amazing Copying:** You can use Copy Power to copy more powerful abilities. In addition to the normal options for using Effort with Copy Power, if you apply two levels of Effort, the GM chooses a high-tier ability that most closely resembles that power (instead of a low-tier ability). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072506 -->

**Amazing Effort:** When you apply at least one level of Effort to a noncombat task, you get a free level of Effort on that task. When you choose this ability, decide if it applies to Might Effort or Speed Effort. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072507 -->

**Amazing Leap (2 Might points):** You leap through the air and land safely some distance away. You can jump up, down, or across to anywhere you choose within long range if you have a clear and unobstructed path to that location. If you have three or more power shifts in strength, your leaping range increases to very long. If you have five or more power shifts in strength, your leaping range increases to 1,000 feet (300 m). Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072508 -->

**Ambusher:** When you attack a creature that has not yet acted during the first round of combat, your attack is eased. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072509 -->

**Amplify Sounds (2 Might points):** For one minute, you can amplify distant or small sounds so that you can hear them clearly, even if it’s a conversation or the sound of a small animal moving through an underground burrow up to a very long distance away. You can attempt to perceive the sound even if interceding barriers block it or the sound is very slight, though this requires a few additional rounds of concentration. To discriminate the sound you wish in a noisy environment might also require a few additional rounds of concentration as you audibly explore the surrounding soundscape. Given enough time, you could pinpoint every conversation, every breathing creature, and every device creating noise within range. Action to initiate, up to several rounds to complete, depending on the difficulty of the task.

<!-- P, ID: 072510 -->

**Anecdote (2 Intellect points):** You can lift the spirits of a group of creatures and help them bond together by entertaining them with an uplifting or pointed anecdote. For the next hour, those who pay attention to your story are trained in a task you choose that’s related to the anecdote, as long as it’s not an attack or defense task. Action to initiate, one minute to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 072511 -->

**Animal Scrying (4+ Intellect points):** If you know the general location of an animal that is friendly toward you and within 1 mile (1.5 km) of your location, you can sense through its senses for up to ten minutes. If you are not in animal form or not in a form similar to that animal, you must apply a level of Effort to use this ability. Action to establish.

<!-- P, ID: 072512 -->

**Animal Shape (3+ Intellect points):** You change into an animal as small as a rat or up to your own size (such as a large dog or small bear) for ten minutes. Each time you transform, you can take a different animal shape. Your equipment becomes part of the transformation, rendering it unusable unless it has a passive effect, such as armor. In this form your stats remain the same as your normal form, but you can move and attack according to your animal shape (attacks from most animals this size are medium weapons, which you can use without penalty). Tasks requiring hands (such as using door handles or pushing buttons) are hindered when in animal form. You cannot speak but can still use abilities that don’t rely on human speech. You gain two minor abilities associated with the creature you become (see the Animal Form Minor Abilities table at the end of the Character Abilities section of this document). For example, if you transform into a bat, you become trained in perception and can fly up to a long distance each round. If you transform into an octopus, you are trained in stealth and can breathe underwater. If you apply a level of Effort when you use this ability, you can either become a talking animal or take a hybrid shape. The talking animal shape looks exactly like a normal animal, but you can still talk and use any abilities that rely on human speech. The hybrid shape is like your normal form but with animalistic features, even if that animal is something much smaller than you (such as a bat or rat). In this hybrid form you can speak, use all of your abilities, make attacks like an animal, and perform tasks using hands without being hindered. Anyone who sees you clearly in this hybrid form would never mistake you for a mere animal. Action to change or revert.

<!-- H, ID: 072513 -->

> “Similar” is a broad term. Lions are similar to tigers and leopards, hawks are similar to ravens and swans, dogs are similar to wolves and foxes, and so on.

<!-- H, ID: 072515 -->

> Even if your animal shape has multiple attack types (such as claws and bite), you can attack only once per round unless you have some other ability that lets you make additional attacks on your turn.

<!-- H, ID: 072517 -->

> **Animal Shape variant:** If your character concept is that you always take the same animal form instead of being able to choose from multiple kinds of animals, double the duration of the Animal Shape ability (to twenty minutes per use). The GM may allow characters with this restriction to learn additional animal forms by spending 4 XP as a long-term benefit.

#### ANIMAL FORM MINOR ABILITIES TABLE

Use the following as examples or suggestions of what a character gains when in the shape of an animal. If an animal shape lists two skills, the character chooses which one they want each time they take that shape.

**Aquatic:** The animal either breathes water instead of air or is able to breathe water in addition to breathing air.

**Armor:** The animal has a thick hide or shell, granting +1 to Armor.

**Constrict:** The animal can grip its opponent fast after making a melee attack (usually with a bite or claw), easing attack rolls against that foe on later turns until it releases the foe.

**Fast:** The animal can move a long distance on its turn instead of a short distance.

**Flying:** The animal can fly, which (depending on the type of animal) may be up to a short or long distance on its turn.

**Hands:** The animal has paws or hands that are nearly as agile as those of a human. Unlike with most animal shapes, the animal’s tasks that require hands are not hindered (although the GM may decide that some tasks requiring human agility, such as playing a flute, are still hindered).

**Scent:** The animal has a strong sense of smell, gaining an asset on tracking and dealing with darkness or blindness.

**Small:** The animal is considerably smaller than a human, easing its Speed defense tasks but hindering tasks to move heavy things.

**Venom:** The animal is poisonous (usually through a bite), inflicting 1 additional point of damage.

<!-- /B -->

<!-- P, ID: 072554 -->

**Animal Senses and Sensibilities:** You are trained in listening and spotting things. In addition, most of the time, the GM should alert you if you’re about to walk into an ambush or a trap that is lower than level 5. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072555 -->

**Answering Attack (3 Speed points):** If you are struck in melee, you can make an immediate melee attack against that attacker once per round. The attack is hindered, and you can still take your normal action during the round. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072556 -->

**Anticipate Attack (4 Intellect points):** You can sense when and how creatures attacking you will make their attacks. Speed defense rolls are eased for one minute. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072557 -->

**Anticipation (1 Intellect point):** You look ahead to see how your actions might unfold. The first task you perform before the end of the next round gains an asset. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072558 -->

**Automatic Glow:** Hard light objects you create with your type and focus abilities shed light, illuminating everything in immediate range. Whenever you want, your body (entirely or just part of it) sheds light, illuminating everything in short range. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072559 -->

**Applying Your Knowledge:** When you help another character undertake any action that you’re untrained in, you are treated as if you are trained in it. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072560 -->

**Apportation (4 Intellect points):** You call a physical object to you. You can choose any piece of normal equipment on the standard equipment list, or (no more than once per day) you can allow the GM to determine the object randomly. If you call a random object, it has a 10 percent chance of being a manifest cypher or artifact, a 50 percent chance of being a piece of standard equipment, and a 40 percent chance of being a bit of worthless junk. You can’t use this ability to take an item held by another creature. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072561 -->

**Aquatic Combatant:** You ignore penalties for any action (including fighting) in underwater environments. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072562 -->

**Arc Spray (3 Speed points):** If a weapon has the ability to fire rapid shots without reloading (usually called a rapid-fire weapon, such as a crank crossbow), you can fire your weapon at up to three targets (all next to one another) at once. Make a separate attack roll against each target. Each attack is hindered. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072563 -->

**Arcane Flare (1 Intellect point):** You enhance the damage of another attack spell with an extra charge of energy so that it deals 1 additional point of damage. Alternatively, you attack a target within long range by projecting a flare of raw magic that inflicts 4 points of damage. Enabler for enhancement; action for long-range attack.

<!-- P, ID: 072564 -->

**Artifact Scavenger (6 Intellect points + 2 XP):** You’ve developed a sixth sense for searching for the most valuable items in the wasteland. If you spend the time required to succeed on two scavenging tasks, you can exchange all the results you would otherwise obtain for a chance to gain an artifact of the GM’s choosing if you succeed on a difficulty 6 Intellect task. You can use this ability at most once per day, and never within the same general area. Action to initiate, several hours to complete.

<!-- P, ID: 072565 -->

**Artifact Tinkerer:** If you spend at least one day tinkering with an artifact in your possession, it functions at one level higher than normal. This applies to all artifacts in your possession, but they retain this bonus only for you. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072566 -->

**As Foretold in Prophecy:** You accomplish something that proves you are truly the chosen one. The next task you attempt is eased by three steps. You can’t use this ability again until after you’ve taken a one-hour or a ten-hour recovery action. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072567 -->

**As If One Creature:** When you and your beast (from your Beast Companion ability) are within immediate distance of each other, you can share damage inflicted on either of you. For instance, if one of you is struck by a weapon for 4 points of damage, divide the damage between the two of you as you see fit. Only the Armor and resistances of the target initially damaged come into play. So if you have 2 Armor and are struck by a force blast for 4 points of damage, your beast can take the 2 points of damage you would suffer, but their Armor does not come into play, nor does their immunity to force blasts, if any. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072568 -->

**Assassin Skills:** You are trained in stealth and disguise tasks. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072569 -->

**Assassin Strike (5 Intellect points):** If you successfully attack a creature that was previously unaware of your presence, you deal 9 additional points of damage. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072570 -->

**Asserting Your Privilege (3 Intellect points):** Acting as only a privileged person can, you verbally harangue a foe who can hear and understand you so forcefully that they are unable to take any action, including attacks, for one round. Whether you succeed or fail, the next action the target takes is hindered. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 072571 -->

**Assume Control (6+ Intellect points):** You control the actions of another creature you have interacted with or studied for at least a round. This effect lasts for ten minutes. The target must be level 2 or lower. Once you have assumed control, the target acts as if it wants to accomplish your desire to the best of its ability, freely using its own best judgment unless you use an action to give it a specific instruction on an issue-by-issue basis. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the target. Thus, to attempt to command a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), you must apply three levels of Effort. When the effect ends, the target remembers everything that happened and reacts according to its nature and your relationship to it; assuming control might have soured that relationship if it was previously a positive one. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 072572 -->

**Athlete:** You are trained in carrying, climbing, jumping, and smashing. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072573 -->

**Attack and Attack Again:** Rather than granting additional damage or a minor or major effect, a natural 17 or higher on your attack roll allows you the option of immediately making another attack. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072574 -->

**Attack Flourish:** With your attack, you add stylish moves, entertaining quips, or a certain something that entertains or impresses others. One creature you choose within short range who can see you gains an asset to its next task if taken within a round or two. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072575 -->

**Augment Cypher (2+ Intellect points):** When you activate a cypher, add +1 to its level. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the level of the cypher by an additional +1 (per level of Effort applied). You can’t increase the cypher’s level above 10. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072576 -->

**Autodoctor:** You are trained in healing, performing surgical procedures, and withstanding pain. You can perform surgeries on yourself, remaining conscious while you do so. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 072577 -->

**Awareness (3 Intellect points):** You become hyperaware of your surroundings in order to better locate your target. For ten minutes, you are aware of all living things within long range (including their general position), and by concentrating (another action), you can attempt to learn the general health and power level of any one of them. Action.
