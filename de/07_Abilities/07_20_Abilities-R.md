### Abilities—R

<!-- P, ID: 073487 -->

**Rally to Me (2 Intellect points):** You cry out, blow a battle horn, or otherwise signal to everyone within very long range that you require aid. All allied creatures who respond by moving to within an immediate distance of you within the next few rounds gain one asset on any one attack or defense task within the next hour that you suggest, such as “Hold the gate,” “Charge that group of orcs,” or something similar. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073488 -->

**Range Increase:** Ranges for you increase by one step. Immediate becomes short, short becomes long, long becomes very long, and very long becomes 1,000 feet (300 m). Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073489 -->

**Rapid Attack (3 Speed points):** Once per round, you can make an additional attack with your chosen weapon. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073490 -->

**Rapid Processing (6 Intellect points):** You or a target you touch experiences a higher level of mental and physical reaction time for about a minute. During that period, all Speed tasks (including Speed defense rolls) are eased. In addition, the target can take one extra action at any time before the ability’s duration expires. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073491 -->

**Rapid Recovery:** You can make most recovery rolls faster than normal. You can make your one-action recovery roll as part of another action or when it isn’t your turn, your ten-minute recovery roll takes you only one action, and your one-hour recovery roll takes you only ten minutes (your ten-hour rest is unchanged). If you make a recovery roll when it isn’t your turn, until the end of your next turn all of your tasks are hindered. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073492 -->

**Ray of Confusion (2 Intellect points):** You project a grey beam of confusion at a creature within short range, inflicting 1 point of damage that ignores Armor. In addition, until the end of the next round, all tasks, attacks, and defenses the target attempts are hindered. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073493 -->

**Reaction:** If a creature you attacked on your last turn with a melee attack uses its action to move out of immediate range, you gain an action to attack the creature as a parting blow, even if you have already taken a turn in the round. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073494 -->

**Reactive Field:** Thanks to a remarkable enhancement of science, magic, psionics, or something even stranger, you now have a force field that radiates 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your body and provides you with +2 to Armor. In addition, if struck by a melee attack, the field creates a backlash that inflicts 4 points of electricity damage to the attacker. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073495 -->

**Read the Signs (4 Intellect points):** You examine an area and learn precise, useful details about the past (if any exist). You can ask the GM up to four questions about the immediate area; each requires its own roll. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073496 -->

**Reading the Room (3 Intellect points):** You gain knowledge about an area by speaking with dead spirits or reading residual energies from the past. You can ask the GM a single, matter-of-fact question about the location and get an answer if you succeed on the Intellect roll. “What killed the cattle in this barn?” is a good example of a simple question. “Why were these cattle killed?” is not an appropriate question because it has more to do with the mindset of the killer than the barn. Simple questions usually have a difficulty of 2, but extremely technical questions or those that involve facts meant to be kept secret can have a much higher difficulty. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073497 -->

**Recruit Deputy:** You gain a level 4 follower. They are not restricted on their modifications. Alternatively, you can choose to advance a level 3 follower you already have to level 4 and then gain a new level 3 follower. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073498 -->

**Recycled Cyphers:** All manifest cyphers you use function at one level higher than normal. In addition, if given a week and at least ten items of junk from the Junk table, you can tinker with one of your manifest cyphers, transforming it into another cypher of the same type that you had in the past. The GM and player should collaborate to ensure that the transformation is logical—for example, you probably can’t transform a pill into a helmet. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073499 -->

**Regenerate:** Your ability to heal (whether from a potent spell, unique mutation, or cybernetic graft) continues to function even if you die from violence, as long as your body is mostly intact. One minute after your death, this ability activates and brings you back to life; however, you come back with a permanent 2-point deduction from your Intellect Pool. Enabler.

<!-- H, ID: 073500 -->

> A character might discover that Regenerate is both a blessing and a curse, because relying on it too much leads to a kind of malaise that vitality alone can‘t fix.

<!-- P, ID: 073502 -->

**Regenerate Other (9 Might points):** You can confer your Regenerate ability on another creature that you touch and attempt to return it to life, as long as its body is mostly intact. (If you don’t have the Regenerate ability, you gain it, but can use it only on yourself.) The difficulty of the task is equal to 3 plus the number of days the target has been dead. (If the body has been perfectly preserved in stasis or through some other non-damaging preservation mechanism, no time limit applies.) Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073503 -->

**Regeneration (6 Intellect points):** You restore points to a target’s Might or Speed Pool in one of two ways: either the chosen Pool regains up to 6 points, or it is restored to a total value of 12. You make this decision when you initiate this ability. Points are regenerated at a rate of 1 point each round. You must remain within immediate range of the target the whole time, either touching them or conversing with them. In no case can this raise a Pool higher than its maximum. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073504 -->

**Reinforcing Field (6+ Intellect points):** You can reinforce any object or structure by infusing it with a force field for one hour. The force field increases the level of the object or structure by 2 for tasks related to durability and withstanding damage and destruction. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073505 -->

**Release Energy:** You release 1 point of energy you’ve absorbed with your Absorb Kinetic Energy ability, magnifying and focusing it into a blast of energy that strikes a single foe within long range for 4 points of damage. (If you don’t have any kinetic energy absorbed, you can still use this ability, but it requires that you transform a fraction of yourself into the blast, which costs 1 point of Might.) Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073506 -->

**Reload (1 Speed point):** When using a weapon that normally requires an action to reload, such as a heavy crossbow, you can reload and fire (or fire and reload) in the same action. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073507 -->

**Relocate (7 Intellect points):** Choose one creature or object within immediate range. You instantly transport it to a new position within long range that you can see. The new position can be any direction from you, but it cannot be inside a solid object. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073508 -->

**Remote Control (5 Intellect points):** You can use a starcraft’s communication and sensor arrays to launch an attack that briefly renders an enemy starcraft within 20 miles (32 km) inoperative for up to a minute. Action.

<!-- H, ID: 073509 -->

> Remote Control is a masterful attempt to jam or hack an enemy spacecraft, a task normally requiring multiple rolls, and you only succeed if you roll a total of three successes before rolling a total of two failures. However, all such tasks are hindered by at least two steps due to hardened spacecraft electronic security.

<!-- P, ID: 073511 -->

**Remote Viewing (6 Intellect points):** Distance is an illusion, as all space is one space. With great concentration, you can see another place. This ability can be used in one of two ways:

<!-- L, ID: 073512 -->

- Distance and direction. Pick a spot a specific distance away and in a specific direction. You can see from that vantage point as if you had used the Sensor ability there, but only for one minute.
- Think of a place you have seen before, either conventionally or using the other application of this power. You can see from that vantage point as if you had used the Sensor ability there, but only for one or two rounds.

<!-- /L -->

<!-- P, ID: 073517 -->

Either application takes anywhere from one action to hours of concentration, depending on what the GM feels is appropriate due to time, distance, or other mitigating circumstances. However, you don’t know in advance how long it will take. Action to initiate; action each round to concentrate.

<!-- P, ID: 073518 -->

**Repair Flesh (3 Intellect points):** When you touch an impaired or debilitated character, you can move them up one step on the damage track (for example, a debilitated PC becomes impaired, and an impaired one becomes hale). Alternatively, if you use this ability on a PC during a rest, you grant them a +2 bonus to their recovery roll. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073519 -->

**Repel Metal:** By manipulating magnetism, you are trained in Speed defense tasks against any incoming attack that uses metal. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073520 -->

**Reshape (5 Intellect points):** You reshape matter within short range in an area no larger than a 5-foot (1.5 m) cube. If you use only one action on this ability, the changes you make are crude at best. If you spend at least ten minutes and succeed at a hindered appropriate crafting task, you can make complex changes to the material. You can’t change the nature of the material, only its shape. Thus, you can make a hole in a wall or floor, or you can seal one up. You can fashion a rudimentary sword from a large piece of iron. You can break or repair a chain. With multiple uses of this ability, you could bring about large changes, making a bridge, a wall, or a similar structure. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073521 -->

**Resilience:** You have 1 point of Armor against any kind of physical damage, even physical damage that normally ignores Armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073522 -->

**Resilient Duplicate:** Increase the health of any duplicate you create (such as with Duplicate) by 5. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073523 -->

**Resilient Ice Armor:** The sheen of ice you generate using your Ice Armor ability gives you an additional +1 to Armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073524 -->

**Resist the Elements:** You resist heat, cold, and similar extremes. You have a special +2 to Armor against ambient damage or other damage that would normally ignore Armor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073525 -->

**Resist Tricks:** You’re trained in solving puzzles and recognizing tricks from years of game playing. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073526 -->

**Resist Underwater Hazards:** Whether you’re resisting crushing waters while exploring the depths or a sting from a poisonous fish, all defense tasks while submerged in water are eased. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073527 -->

**Resonance Field (1 Intellect point):** Faint lines in a color you choose form a tracery over your entire body and emit faint light. The effect lasts for one minute. Whenever a creature within immediate range makes an attack against you, the pattern energizes to block the attack. You can make an Intellect defense roll in place of the defense roll you would normally make. If you do so and you get a minor effect, the creature attacking you takes 1 point of damage. If you get a major effect, the creature attacking you takes 4 points of damage. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073528 -->

**Resonant Frequency:** You can infuse an item of up to level 7 that you can hold in one hand with a special vibration generated from your core. The object then functions as if two levels higher for one minute. At the end of that minute, the resonant frequency ramps up exponentially until the object finally shatters from the energy buildup. Anything within immediate range of the detonation suffers 5 points of damage. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073529 -->

**Resonant Quake (7 Intellect points):** You can infuse the ground beneath you with a special vibration generated from your core. This creates a small quake whose epicenter you can select within a very long distance. Everyone within short range of the epicenter is subject to 8 points of damage (from shaking and being struck by toppling objects, crumbling walls, and so on). However, you are dazed for a round afterward yourself, during which time all your tasks are hindered. If you have the Move Mountains ability, both abilities cost 3 fewer Intellect points to use. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073530 -->

**Restful Presence:** Creatures who make a recovery roll within short range of you add +1 to their roll. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073531 -->

**Restore Life (9+ Intellect points):** You can attempt to restore life to a dead creature of up to level 3, as long as the corpse is no more than a day old and is mostly intact. You can also attempt to restore life to a corpse that is much older but is especially well preserved. The difficulty of the Intellect task is equal to the level of the creature you’re attempting to restore to life. For each additional level of Effort applied, you can attempt to restore the life of a creature whose level is 1 higher. When first restored to life, a creature is dazed for at least a day, and all tasks they attempt are hindered. Action; one minute to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073532 -->

**Restorative Bloom (5 Might points):** When Wooden Body or Great Tree is in effect, you produce a flower, acorn, fruit, or similar plant-based edible item. A creature that eats this food is nourished for a full day and restores their Might Pool, Speed Pool, and Intellect Pool to their maximum values, as if they were fully rested. Eating a second food produced by this ability in a day has no effect. If the food is not eaten within ten minutes, it spoils. Action to produce, action to eat.

<!-- P, ID: 073533 -->

**Resuscitate (6 Intellect points):** You can resuscitate a character who is up to two steps down on the damage track as your action. The target ascends one step on the damage track. If a character has dropped all three steps on the damage track (dead) but is otherwise in one piece and less than a minute has passed since they descended to the third step, you can resuscitate them if you succeed at a level 6 healing task. If you use this ability on an NPC who has no health but has been dead for less than a minute and is otherwise in one piece, the NPC is resuscitated with 1 health. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073534 -->

**Retinue:** Four level 2 followers join you (and your first follower, if you have one). One of their modifications must be for tasks related to serving as your personal assistants. In addition to other tasks they might individually take on your behalf, they can also work together to run interference if you’re trying to avoid someone, help hide you from the attention of others, help you muscle through a crowd, and so on. If a situation becomes physically violent, they provide an asset to your Speed defense tasks and, if you command it, try to hold a foe’s attention while you escape. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073535 -->

**Retrieve Memories (3 Intellect points):** You touch the remains of a recently killed creature and make an Intellect-based roll to restore its mind to life long enough to learn information from it. The GM sets the difficulty based on the amount of time that has passed since the creature died. A creature that has been dead for only a few minutes is a difficulty 2 task, one that has been dead for an hour is a difficulty 4 task, and one that has been dead for a few days is a difficulty 9 task. If you succeed, you awaken the corpse, causing its head to animate and perceive things as if it were alive. This enables communication for about one minute, which is how long it takes for the creature to realize that it’s dead. The creature is limited to what it knew in life, though it cannot recall minor memories, only big events of importance to it. When the effect ends, or if you fail the roll, the creature’s brain dissolves to mush and cannot be awakened again. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073536 -->

**Return to Sender (3 Speed points):** If you succeed at a Speed defense task against a melee attack, you can make an immediate melee attack against your foe. You can use this ability only once per round. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073537 -->

**Return to the Obelisk (7+ Intellect points):** You transfer your body and personal possessions into a crystal of any size that you can touch, and you exit from another crystal of any size, including any crystal obelisks that you are aware of. You must know of the crystal you are going to use as an exit before you enter the first crystal. You can take one additional creature with you for each level of Effort applied. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073538 -->

**Reveal (2+ Intellect points):** You adjust a creature’s eyesight so that it can see normally in areas of dim light and darkness. You can affect one willing creature within immediate range for one hour. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort applied affects two additional targets. You must touch additional targets to affect them. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073539 -->

**Ribbons of Dark Matter (2 Intellect points):** For the next minute, dark matter condenses within an area within long range that is no bigger than an immediate distance in diameter, manifesting as swirling ribbons. All tasks attempted by creatures in the area are hindered, and leaving the area requires a creature’s entire action to move. You can dismiss the dark matter early as an action. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073540 -->

**Rider:** You are trained in riding any kind of creature that serves as a mount, such as a noble warhorse. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073541 -->

**Roaming Third Eye (3 Intellect points):** When you use your Third Eye ability, you can place the sensor anywhere within long range. In addition, until that ability ends, you can use an action to move the sensor anywhere within short range of its starting position. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073542 -->

**Robot Assistant:** A level 2 robot of your size or smaller (built by you) accompanies you and follows your instructions. You and the GM must work out the details of your robot. You’ll probably make rolls for it when it takes actions. A robot assistant in combat usually doesn’t make separate attacks but helps with yours. On your action, if the artificial assistant is next to you, it serves as an asset for one attack you make on your turn. If the robot is destroyed, you can repair the original with a few days’ worth of tinkering, or build a new one with a week’s worth of half-time labor. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073543 -->

**Robot Builder:** You are trained in tasks related to building and repairing robots. For the purposes of repair, you can use this skill to heal robots that use similar technology. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073544 -->

**Robot Control (2+ Intellect points):** You use your knowledge of robot command and control (and possibly devices that transmit on the proper frequency) to affect any mechanized system or robot of level 2 or lower within short range. You can render several targets inactive for as long as you focus all your attention on them. If you focus on just one target, you can attempt to take active control of it for one minute, commanding it to do simple tasks on your behalf while you concentrate. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to increase the maximum level of the mechanized system or robot. Thus, to affect a level 4 target (two levels above the normal limit), you must apply two levels of Effort. Action to initiate.

<!-- P, ID: 073545 -->

**Robot Evolution:** Your first artificial assistant from the Robot Assistant ability increases to level 5, and each of your level 2 robots from Robot Fleet increases to level 3. Instead of choosing this option, you may instead choose one upgrade from the Robot Upgrade ability. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073546 -->

**Robot Fighter:** When fighting a robot or intelligent machine, you are trained in attacks and defense. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073547 -->

**Robot Fleet:** You build up to four level 2 robot assistants, each no larger than yourself. (They are in addition to the assistant you built at first tier with Robot Assistant, which may have seen a few upgrades since then.) You and the GM must work out the details of these additional robots. If a robot is destroyed, you can build a new one (or repair the old one from its parts) after a week of half-time labor. Instead of this ability, you can select one of the following abilities: Expert Follower, Robot Control, or Robot Upgrade. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073548 -->

**Robot Improvement:** Your artificial assistant from the Robot Assistant ability increases to level 4. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073549 -->

**Robot Upgrade:** You modify your artificial assistant from the Robot Assistant ability with one new capability. Standard options include the following. Work with your GM if you prefer a different capability.

<!-- P, ID: 073550 -->

_Cypher Pod._ The robot can carry one extra manifest cypher for you. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073551 -->

_Flight._ The robot can fly a long distance each round. It can carry you, but only for up to an hour between each of your ten-hour recovery rolls. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073552 -->

_Force Shield._ The robot can erect an opaque level 5 force field around itself and anyone within 10 feet (3 m) of it for one minute (or until it is destroyed). It cannot do so again until after your next recovery roll. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073553 -->

_Mounted Laser Configuration._ The robot can reconfigure itself and become an immobile laser weapon on a gimbal mount. In this configuration, the robot is a heavy weapon that deals 7 points of damage. If the robot acts as an autonomous turret, treat it as one level lower than its normal level. However, if the laser is fired by you or someone else who has your permission, the laser attacks are eased. Action to reconfigure; action to return to normal robot configuration.

<!-- P, ID: 073554 -->

**Ruin Lore:** You are trained in scavenging, which means you’re more likely to find useful things, and junk that can potentially be turned into useful things in the ruins of what came before. Enabler.

<!-- P, ID: 073555 -->

**Run and Fight (4 Might points):** You can move a short distance and make a melee attack that inflicts 2 additional points of damage. Action.

<!-- P, ID: 073556 -->

**Runner:** Your standard movement increases from short to long. Enabler.
