### CUSTOMIZING DESCRIPTORS

<!-- P, ID: 051060 -->

Under the normal rules, each descriptor is based on some modification of the following guidelines:

<!-- L, ID: 051061 -->

- Some descriptors offer +4 to one stat Pool and either two narrow skills or one broad skill.
- Other descriptors offer +2 to one stat Pool and either three narrow skills or one narrow skill and one broad skill.
- A broad skill covers many areas (such as all interactions). A narrow skill covers fewer areas (such as deceptive interactions). Combat-related skills, such as defense or initiative, are considered broad skills in this sense.
- Regardless, you can add an additional skill if it is balanced by an inability.
- You can add other non-skill abilities by eyeballing them and trying to equate them to the value of a skill, if possible. If the descriptor seems lacking, add a moderately priced item as additional equipment to balance things out.

With this general information, you can customize a descriptor, but keep in mind that a heavily customized descriptor isn’t a descriptor if it no longer says one thing about a character. It’s better to use this information to create a new descriptor that fits exactly how the player wants to portray the character.
