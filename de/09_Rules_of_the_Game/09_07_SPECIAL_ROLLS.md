### SPECIAL ROLLS

<!-- P, ID: 090090 -->

If a character rolls a natural 1, 17, 18, 19, or 20 (meaning the d20 shows that number), special rules come into play. These are explained in more detail in the following sections.

<!-- P, ID: 090091 -->

**1: GM Intrusion.** The GM makes a free intrusion (see below) and doesn’t award experience points (XP) for it.

<!-- P, ID: 090092 -->

**17: Damage Bonus.** If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 1 additional point of damage.

<!-- P, ID: 090093 -->

**18: Damage Bonus.** If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 2 additional points of damage.

<!-- P, ID: 090094 -->

**19: Minor Effect.** If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 3 additional points of damage or the PC gets a minor effect in addition to the normal results of the task. If the roll was something other than an attack, the PC gets a minor effect in addition to the normal results of the task.

<!-- P, ID: 090095 -->

**20: Major Effect.** If the roll was a damage-dealing attack, it deals 4 additional points of damage or the PC gets a major or minor effect in addition to the normal results of the task. If the roll was something other than an attack, the PC gets a major effect in addition to the normal results of the task. If the PC spent points from a stat Pool on the action, the point cost for the action decreases to 0, meaning the character regains those points as if they had not spent them at all.

#### GM INTRUSION

<!-- P, ID: 090098 -->

GM intrusion is explained in more detail in the Running the Cypher System chapter, but essentially it means that something occurs to complicate the character’s life. The character hasn’t necessarily fumbled or done anything wrong (although perhaps they did). It could just be that the task presents an unexpected difficulty or something unrelated affects the current situation.

<!-- P, ID: 090099 -->

For GM intrusion on a defense roll, a roll of 1 might mean that the PC takes 2 additional points of damage from the attack, indicating that the opponent got in a lucky blow.

#### MINOR EFFECT

<!-- P, ID: 090104 -->

A minor effect happens when a player rolls a natural 19. Most of the time, a minor effect is slightly beneficial to the PC, but not overwhelming.

<!-- P, ID: 090105 -->

A climber gets up the steep slope a bit faster. A repaired machine works a bit better. A character jumping down into a pit lands on their feet. Either the GM or the player can come up with a possible minor effect that fits the situation, but both must agree on what it should be.

<!-- P, ID: 090106 -->

Don’t waste a lot of time thinking of a minor effect if nothing appropriate suggests itself. Sometimes, in cases where only success or failure matters, it’s okay to have no minor effect. Keep the game moving at an exciting pace.

<!-- P, ID: 090107 -->

In combat, the easiest and most straightforward minor effect is dealing 3 additional points of damage with an attack. The following are other common minor effects for combat:

<!-- P, ID: 090108 -->

**Damage object:** Instead of striking the foe, the attack strikes what the foe is holding. If the attack hits, the character makes a Might roll with a difficulty equal to the object’s level. On a success, the object moves one or more steps down the object damage track.

<!-- P, ID: 090109 -->

**Distract:** For one round, all of the foe’s tasks are hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 090110 -->

**Knock back:** The foe is knocked or forced back a few feet. Most of the time, this doesn’t matter much, but if the fight takes place on a ledge or next to a pit of lava, the effect can be significant.

<!-- P, ID: 090111 -->

**Move past:** The character can move a short distance at the end of the attack. This effect is useful to get past a foe guarding a door, for example.

<!-- P, ID: 090112 -->

**Strike a specific body part:** The attacker strikes a specific spot on the defender’s body. The GM rules what special effect, if any, results. For example, hitting a creature’s tentacle that is wrapped around an ally might make it easier for the ally to escape. Hitting a foe in the eye might blind it for one round. Hitting a creature in its one vulnerable spot might ignore Armor.

<!-- P, ID: 090113 -->

Usually, the GM just has the desired minor effect occur. For example, rolling a 19 against a relatively weak foe means it is knocked off the cliff. The effect makes the round more exciting, but the defeat of a minor creature has no significant impact on the story. Other times, the GM might rule that an additional roll is needed to achieve the effect—the special roll only gives the PC the opportunity for a minor effect. This mostly happens when the desired effect is very unlikely, such as pushing a 50-ton battle automaton off a cliff. If the player just wants to deal 3 additional points of damage as the minor effect, no extra roll is needed.

#### MAJOR EFFECT

<!-- P, ID: 090116 -->

A major effect happens when a player rolls a natural 20. Most of the time, a major effect is quite beneficial to the character. A climber gets up the steep slope in half the time. A jumper lands with such panache that those nearby are impressed and possibly intimidated. A defender makes a free attack on a foe.

<!-- P, ID: 090117 -->

Either the GM or the player can come up with a possible major effect that fits the situation, but both must agree on what it should be. As with minor effects, don’t spend a lot of time agonizing over the details of a major effect. In cases where only success or failure matters, a major effect might offer the character a one-time asset (a modification of one step) to use the next time they attempt a similar action. When nothing else seems appropriate, the GM can simply grant the PC an additional action on their turn that same round.

<!-- P, ID: 090118 -->

In combat, the easiest and most straightforward major effect is dealing 4 additional points of damage with an attack. The following are other common major effects for combat.

<!-- P, ID: 090119 -->

**Disarm:** The foe drops one object that it is holding.

<!-- P, ID: 090120 -->

**Impair:** For the rest of the combat, all tasks the foe attempts are hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 090121 -->

**Knock down:** The foe is knocked prone. It can get up on its turn.

<!-- P, ID: 090122 -->

**Stun:** The foe loses its next action.

<!-- P, ID: 090123 -->

As with minor effects, usually the GM just has the desired major effect occur, but sometimes the GM might require an extra roll if the major effect is unusual or unlikely.
