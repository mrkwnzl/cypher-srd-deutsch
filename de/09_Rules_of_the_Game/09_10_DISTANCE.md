### DISTANCE

<!-- P, ID: 090136 -->

Distance is simplified into four basic categories: immediate, short, long, and very long.

<!-- P, ID: 090137 -->

Immediate distance from a character is within reach or within a few steps; if a character stands in a small room, everything in the room is within immediate distance. At most, immediate distance is 10 feet (3 m). Immediate distance is sometimes referred to as close, or even point-blank, particularly when referring to ranges.

> The words “immediate” and “close” can be used interchangeably to talk about distance. If a creature or object is within arm’s reach of the character, it can be considered both immediate and close.

**Short distance** is anything greater than immediate distance but less than 50 feet (15 m) or so.

<!-- P, ID: 090141 -->

**Long distance** is anything greater than short distance but less than 100 feet (30 m) or so.

<!-- P, ID: 090142 -->

**Very long distance** is anything greater than long distance but less than 500 feet (150 m) or so. Beyond that range, distances are always specified—1,000 feet (300 m), 1 mile (1.5 km), and so on.

All weapons and special abilities use these terms for ranges. For example, all melee weapons have immediate range—they are close-combat weapons, and you can use them to attack anyone within immediate distance. A thrown knife (and most other thrown weapons) has short range. A small handgun also has short range. A rifle has long range.

A character can move an immediate distance as a part of another action. In other words, they can take a few steps to the light switch and flip it on. They can lunge across a small room to attack a foe. They can open a door and step through.

A character can move a short distance as their entire action for a turn. They can also try to move a long distance as their entire action, but the player might have to roll to see if the character slips, trips, or stumbles for moving so far so quickly.

GMs and players don’t need to determine exact distances. For example, if the PCs are fighting a group of guards, any character can likely attack any foe in the general melee—they’re all within immediate range. However, if one trooper stays back to fire a blaster, a character might have to use their entire action to move the short distance required to attack that foe. It doesn’t matter if the trooper is 20 feet (6 m) or 40 feet (12 m) away—it’s simply considered short distance. It does matter if the trooper is more than 50 feet (15 m) away because that distance would require a long move.

#### OTHER DISTANCES

<!-- P, ID: 090150 -->

In rare cases where distances beyond very long are needed, real-world distances are best (1 mile, 100 kilometers, and so on). However, the following shorthand distances can be useful in some settings:

<!-- P, ID: 090151 -->

**Planetary:** On the same planet.

<!-- P, ID: 090152 -->

**Interplanetary:** Within the same solar system.

<!-- P, ID: 090153 -->

**Interstellar:** Within the same galaxy.

<!-- P, ID: 090154 -->

**Intergalactic:** Anywhere in the same universe.

<!-- P, ID: 090155 -->

**Interdimensional:** Anywhere.
