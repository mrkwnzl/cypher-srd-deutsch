**Book:** A book with information on a particular topic, such as geography, history, magic, or religion. Provides an asset on appropriate rolls if the character reads or skims the book for at least ten minutes before attempting the task (this assumes the character has already read the book and is looking for relevant information).

<!-- P, ID: 080220 -->

**Caltrops, bag:** A bag of hard things you scatter on the ground to slow or injure anyone walking through an area. One bag covers an immediate area and makes that area count as difficult terrain. A creature can safely move through it as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 2 Speed defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).

<!-- P, ID: 080221 -->

**Candle:** A candle burns for one hour and creates dim light in an immediate area.

<!-- P, ID: 080222 -->

**Climbing kit:** A set of crampons, pitons, ropes, and tools. Provides an asset on climbing tasks.

<!-- P, ID: 080226 -->

**Lamp:** A hollow container filled with oil that slowly burns to provide light (often resembling a “genie lamp”). A lamp creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it might spill oil, break, or both.

<!-- P, ID: 080227 -->

**Lantern:** An improved version of a lamp, with a wick that draws oil and glass or metal panes to protect it from wind. A lantern creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it is less likely to spill than a lamp.

<!-- P, ID: 080228 -->

**Lockpicks:** Also known as thieves’ tools, this set provides everything a skilled person needs to pick locks and disarm traps.

<!-- P, ID: 080229 -->

**Manacles:** Metal or heavy wooden restraints that hold an enemy’s wrists or ankles in place and are secured with a pin. A common set of manacles is level 5.

<!-- P, ID: 080230 -->

**Oil:** A pint (.5 L) of lamp oil in a leather flask. It burns for three to four hours in a lantern or lamp. If prepped with a burning wick, it can be thrown, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured on a flat surface, it makes an immediate area slippery. A creature can safely move through the oil slick as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 3 Speed defense roll or slip on the oil and fall prone. Lighting the oil slick makes it burn for one or two rounds and inflicts 1 point of fire damage (ignores Armor) on anyone in or moving through the area.

<!-- P, ID: 080231 -->

**Signal horn:** This horn can be heard up to a mile away.

<!-- P, ID: 080232 -->

**Tent:** This has enough room for two humans or three smaller people.

<!-- P, ID: 080234 -->

**Torch:** A wooden stick with some kind of fuel on one end (such as burlap and wax). It burns for one hour, creating normal light in an immediate area and dim light in the short area beyond that. A torch is fragile and usually breaks if used to hit something
