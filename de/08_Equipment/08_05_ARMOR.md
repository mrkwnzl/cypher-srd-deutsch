### ARMOR

<!-- P, ID: 080064 -->

Characters expecting danger frequently wear armor. Even the simplest protective covering helps against stabs and cuts, and more sophisticated or heavier armor protects against graver threats.

<!-- P, ID: 080065 -->

You can wear only one type of armor at a time—you cannot wear chainmail hauberk and scale armor together, for example. However, Armor bonuses from multiple sources combine to provide a total Armor rating. For example, if you have subdermal implants that give you +1 to Armor, a force field that offers another +1 to Armor, and beastskin that grants +2 to Armor, you have a total of +4 to Armor.

In general, light armor is a moderately priced item, medium armor is expensive, and heavy armor is very expensive. The Genre chapter offers more specific details on the kinds of armor available in a given setting. Keep in mind that in many genres, it’s quite odd, at best, to run around in armor tougher than a leather jacket.

#### USING ARMOR

<!-- P, ID: 080069 -->

Anyone can wear any armor, but it can be taxing. Wearing armor increases the cost of using a level of Effort when attempting a Speed-based action. So if you’re wearing light armor and want to use two levels of Effort on a Speed-based roll to run across difficult terrain, it costs 7 points from your Speed Pool rather than 5 (3 for the first level of Effort, plus 2 for the second level of Effort, plus 1 per level for wearing light armor). Edge reduces the overall cost as normal. If you are not experienced with a certain type of armor but wear it anyway, this cost is further increased by 1. Having experience with a type of armor is called being practiced with the armor.

| Armor  | Speed Effort Additional Cost Per Level |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Light  | +1                                     |
| Medium | +2                                     |
| Heavy  | +3                                     |

#### FANTASY ARMOR DESCRIPTIONS

<!-- P, ID: 080077 -->

You can wear only one kind of armor at a time (wearing more than one only gives the Armor from the best one and the Speed Effort cost of the worst one).

<!-- P, ID: 080078 -->

**Beastskin:** An improved form of hides and furs, usually crafted from a creature with especially tough skin such as a giant lizard or rhinoceros.

<!-- P, ID: 080079 -->

**Breastplate:** A fitted metal plate or set of plates that protect your torso but not your arms or legs, giving you greater movement than full plate at the cost of some protection.

<!-- P, ID: 080080 -->

**Brigandine:** Long strips of metal attached to a cloth or leather backing. Often called “splint mail.”

<!-- P, ID: 080081 -->

**Chainmail:** Mail armor made from hundreds of interlocking metal rings or links. Often called “chain” or “chain armor.”

<!-- P, ID: 080082 -->

**Dwarven breastplate:** A high-quality breastplate crafted by a skilled dwarf, providing good protection and great mobility. Dwarven breastplate is medium armor (2 Armor) but encumbers the wearer as if it were light armor (it has a Speed Effort cost of 1). Not all dwarf-crafted breastplates count as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled dwarven smiths know how to make it).

<!-- P, ID: 080083 -->

**Elven chainmail:** A high-quality suit of chainmail crafted by a skilled elf, providing good protection and excellent mobility. Elven chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor) but is no more encumbering than a typical outfit of normal clothing (it has no Speed Effort cost). Not all elf-crafted chainmail counts as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled elven smiths know how to make it).

<!-- P, ID: 080084 -->

**Full plate:** A complete suit of fitted metal plates that give excellent coverage and protection against attacks. The joints are protected by small layered plates over flexible chain. Sometimes called “plate mail.”

<!-- P, ID: 080085 -->

**Heavy cloth:** Clothing that’s heavy enough to reduce the effect of attacks against you, such as winter clothing or a fashionable leather outfit. Heavy cloth provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Heavy cloth doesn’t have a Speed Effort cost. It can’t be worn with other kinds of armor.

<!-- P, ID: 080086 -->

**Hides and furs:** Made from thick or poorly cured animal skins. It’s heavier and bulkier than other kinds of leather armor, but easier to make, especially by resource-poor crafters.

<!-- P, ID: 080087 -->

**Leather jerkin:** Armor made of hardened pieces of leather (usually boiled or treated with chemicals) that mainly covers your torso. It’s stiffer than leather used for clothing, but still flexible enough that you can bend and twist in it. Some jerkins are reinforced with metal studs (and may be called “studded leather”), and brigandine improves upon that concept.

<!-- P, ID: 080088 -->

**Padded:** Cloth armor that is deliberately designed with multiple layers to be thick and protective. This is sometimes called “quilted armor” because it is a layer of padding sewn between two layers of cloth. Padded armor provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Padded armor doesn’t have a Speed Effort cost. It can’t be worn with other kinds of armor.

<!-- P, ID: 080089 -->

**Scale:** Mail armor made from overlapping scales or plates attached to a leather or cloth backing. Often called “scale mail.”

<!-- P, ID: 080090 -->

**Shield:** Provides an asset to Speed defense. Shield sizes vary from a small buckler to a large kite shield (in the Cypher System, the difference is mainly flavor, and for game purposes they all grant the wearer the same benefit).

\*\* Using a shield provides the wearer with an asset on Speed defense tasks

<!-- H, ID: 080112 -->

> If the GM prefers the simpler method of not tracking whether an attack is bashing, slashing, or stabbing, heavy cloth and padded armor should provide no Armor at all.

Shields

<!-- P, ID: 080115 -->

Shields provide an asset to Speed defense rolls. You must have one free hand to use a shield.
