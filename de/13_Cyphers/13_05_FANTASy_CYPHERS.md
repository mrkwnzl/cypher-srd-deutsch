### FANTASy CYPHERS

<!-- P, ID: 130046 -->

Magic items are a staple of fantasy stories and games. In the Cypher System, these magic items are, of course, cyphers. The Cypher System assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but in a fantasy game the assumption is usually the opposite—cyphers are physical objects (manifest cyphers) with magical powers, which the heroes find as treasure, gifts, or rewards for their adventures and exploits.

#### MIXING SUBTLE AND MANIFEST CYPHERS

<!-- P, ID: 130049 -->

There’s no reason why a fantasy campaign can’t use manifest cyphers and subtle cyphers. In this setup, manifest cyphers are the tangible objects found in treasure hoards, and subtle cyphers represent good fortune, the blessings of the gods, and other coincidences that benefit the characters.

#### CYPHER FORMS

<!-- P, ID: 130052 -->

What form a manifest cypher takes—such as a potion or scroll—doesn’t affect its abilities at all. A potion that eases the user’s next task by three steps is functionally identical to a magical scroll that does the same thing.

To randomly determine a manifest cypher’s form, roll on the following table.

<!-- /T -->

##### ACID RESISTANCE

<!-- P, ID: 130115 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

<!-- P, ID: 130116 -->

**Effect:** The user gains Armor against acid damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

##### ANIMAL CONTROL

<!-- P, ID: 130119 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

<!-- P, ID: 130120 -->

**Effect:** To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on an Intellect attack against a beast whose level does not exceed the cypher’s level. If successful, the beast immediately becomes calm. The beast awaits the user’s commands and carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher’s level minus the target’s level. (If the result is 0, the target is enslaved for only one minute.) The beast could attack or defend, a dog could follow a scent or retrieve an object, a badger could dig a hole, and so on.

<!-- P, ID: 130121 -->

The cypher doesn’t give the user any special ability to understand the target or perceive through its senses. For example, the user can command an eagle to fly above a group of enemies, but the eagle can’t describe what it sees and the user can’t look through its eyes.

<!-- H, ID: 130122 -->

> “Beast” in this sense refers to creatures of animal-level intelligence and may include unintelligent magical creatures like basilisks, pegasi, and so on.

##### BEAST SHAPE

<!-- P, ID: 130126 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130127 -->

**Effect:** The user transforms into a specific kind of animal, such as a bear, hawk, horse, or wolf (the kind of animal is determined by the cypher’s creator). The user gains the animal’s type of movement (swimming for a fish, flying for a bird, and so on) and two assets on tasks to pretend to be that animal. The user also gains an asset on one skill appropriate to their animal form (or two skills for cypher level 5 and higher). See the Animal Form Minor Abilities table.

<!-- P, ID: 130128 -->

The magic shrinks or enlarges the user to a size more suitable for their animal form, but generally can’t make them more than about 50 percent smaller or larger, so the user might become an unusually large bird or a small bear. This doesn’t affect the animal’s abilities. The user can still use all of their abilities that don’t rely specifically on their normal form. For example, an Adept in wolf form can’t wield a dagger because wolves don’t have hands, but could still use a healing power or mind blast ability.

<!-- P, ID: 130129 -->

After about an hour, the user returns to their normal form.

<!-- H, ID: 130130 -->

> Depending on the cypher, the user might still be able to speak in a humanoid language, talk in a “language” of animal noises that other transformed people can understand perfectly, speak with animals of the same kind, or none of the above.

##### COLD RESISTANCE

<!-- P, ID: 130134 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

<!-- P, ID: 130135 -->

**Effect:** The user gains Armor against cold damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

##### DEMON WARD

<!-- P, ID: 130138 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130139 -->

**Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from demons, devils, and similar malevolent creatures.

##### DRAGON WARD

<!-- P, ID: 130142 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130143 -->

**Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from dragons, wyverns, and similar magical reptilian creatures.

<!-- H, ID: 130144 -->

> In a typical fantasy campaign, a demon is a supernatural being from another dimension or plane of existence.

##### ELECTRICITY RESISTANCE

<!-- P, ID: 130148 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

<!-- P, ID: 130149 -->

**Effect:** The user gains Armor against electricity damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

##### ELEMENTAL CONJURATION

<!-- P, ID: 130152 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130153 -->

**Effect:** Summons an elemental creature (air, earth, fire, or water) that can understand the verbal commands of the user. Once the elemental is summoned, commanding it is not an action. It can make attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but it cannot speak. The elemental never goes farther than long range away from the user.

<!-- P, ID: 130154 -->

The elemental is not particularly intelligent or capable of initiating action. It responds if attacked, but otherwise does only as commanded.

<!-- P, ID: 130155 -->

The elemental remains for one hour per cypher level or until its physical form is destroyed, after which it vanishes back to its native realm.

##### FIRE RESISTANCE

<!-- P, ID: 130158 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

<!-- P, ID: 130159 -->

**Effect:** The user gains Armor against fire damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

##### GIANT SIZE

<!-- P, ID: 130162 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130163 -->

**Effect:** The user grows to about one and a half times their normal size. While at this larger size, they add 4 points to their Might Pool and +2 to their Might Edge, but their Speed defense rolls are hindered.

<!-- P, ID: 130164 -->

They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends, their Might Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Speed defense, and they subtract 4 points from their Might Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Speed Pool and then, if necessary, from their Intellect Pool).

<!-- P, ID: 130165 -->

If the user is an NPC, the cypher increases their health by 4, eases their Might-based tasks, and hinders their Speed defense. When the effect ends, they lose 4 health and all of the other advantages and penalties from the cypher.

##### INSTANT BOAT

<!-- P, ID: 130168 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

<!-- P, ID: 130169 -->

**Effect:** Creates or transforms into a small sailboat that can carry up to eight people. The user or other characters must row, steer, and sail the boat as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the boat grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the boat can move a short distance each round under its own power. The boat lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.

##### INSTANT TOWER

<!-- P, ID: 130172 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

<!-- P, ID: 130173 -->

**Effect:** Creates a simple, squat stone tower with a door, three arrow slits, and a ceiling hatch leading to the roof. The tower is 10 feet (3 m) square and 12 feet (4 m) tall. If the cypher level is 7 or higher, the tower also has a second story (with four arrow slits), increasing its total height to 20 feet (6 m). If there isn’t sufficient room for the tower to reach its full size, it fills the available space, but its appearance and growth does not apply any force or pressure against the confining surfaces.

<!-- P, ID: 130174 -->

The tower is permanent and immobile once created.

##### LYCANTHROPE WARD

<!-- P, ID: 130177 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130178 -->

**Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from werewolves and other lycanthropes.

<!-- H, ID: 130179 -->

> **Lycanthrope:** Formally, a human who can transform into a wolf. Informally, a human who can transform into an animal, such as a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf.

##### PENULTIMATE KEY

<!-- P, ID: 130183 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 2

<!-- P, ID: 130184 -->

**Effect:** Locks or unlocks any one door, portal, chest, or other lockable item of the cypher’s level or lower. The targeted item must have a keyhole for the cypher to work.

<!-- H, ID: 130185 -->

> Legends speak of the Ultimate Key, which can open any lock, even those sealed by a god.

##### POISON RESISTANCE

<!-- P, ID: 130189 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 3

<!-- P, ID: 130190 -->

**Effect:** The user gains Armor against poison damage equal to the cypher’s level for one hour.

##### RESTORATIVE AURA

<!-- P, ID: 130193 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130194 -->

**Effect:** Creates an immediate area filled with aromatic smoke, reassuring sounds, gentle light, or other pleasing sensations that last for one hour. Creatures who rest within the area gain +2 on their recovery rolls (or +4 for cypher level 5 and higher). NPCs instead recover 2 health if they spend at least ten minutes within the area (or 4 health for cypher level 5 and higher). For a creature to gain this benefit, its entire rest must occur while the cypher is active.

##### THOUGHT LISTENING

<!-- P, ID: 130197 -->

**Level:** 1d6 + 1

<!-- P, ID: 130198 -->

**Effect:** The user can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range that they can see, even if the target doesn’t want them to. Once the user has established contact, they can read the target’s thoughts for up to one minute per cypher level.

##### TINY SIZE

<!-- P, ID: 130201 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130202 -->

**Effect:** The user shrinks to about one-tenth their normal size. While at this smaller size, they add 4 points to their Speed Pool and +2 to their Speed Edge, but all of their Might actions are hindered by two steps.

<!-- P, ID: 130203 -->

They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends, their Speed Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Might actions, and they subtract 4 points from their Speed Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Intellect Pool and then, if necessary, from their Might Pool).

<!-- P, ID: 130204 -->

If the user is an NPC, the cypher eases their Speed-based tasks and hinders their Might-based tasks. When the effect ends, they lose all of the advantages and penalties from the cypher.

##### UNDEAD WARD

<!-- P, ID: 130207 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130208 -->

**Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher’s level against damage from skeletons, zombies, ghosts, vampires, and other undead creatures.

##### WALKING CORPSE

<!-- P, ID: 130211 -->

**Level:** 1d6

<!-- P, ID: 130212 -->

**Effect:** Animates a corpse as a level 1 (or level 2 for cypher level 5 and higher) undead skeleton or zombie, depending on the condition of the body. The corpse can be no larger than a typical human. The animated corpse has none of the intelligence, memories, or special abilities that it had in life. The creature follows the user’s verbal commands for one hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the creature is killed by damage, the user can reanimate it again when its time expires, but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly reanimated state.
