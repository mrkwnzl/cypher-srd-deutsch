### MANIFEST CYPHER FORMS

<!-- P, ID: 130247 -->

None of the manifest cyphers in this chapter have a stated physical form. The entries don’t tell you if something is a potion, a pill, or a device you hold in your hands because that sort of detail varies greatly from genre to genre. Are they magic? Are they tech? Are they symbiotic creatures with programmed DNA? That’s up to the GM. It’s flavor, not mechanics. It’s as important or unimportant as the style of an NPC’s hair or the color of the car the bad guys are driving. In other words, it’s the kind of thing that is important in a roleplaying game, but at the same time doesn’t actually change anything (and RPGs have a lot of things like that, if you think about it).

A manifest cypher’s physical form can be anything at all, but there are some obvious choices based on genre. The GM can design a setting that uses just one type—for example, a magical world where all cyphers are potions made by faeries. Or they can use many types, perhaps mixing them from different genres. Some suggestions include the following.
